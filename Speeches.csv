10001,"Franklin D. Roosevelt, Presidential Inauguration Speech",https://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/froos4.asp,Harry S. Truman,President (United States),Inauguration Speech,1945,,"Mr. Chief Justice, Mr. Vice President, my friends, you will understand and, I believe, agree with my wish that the form of this inauguration be simple and its words brief.

We Americans of today, together with our allies, are passing through a period of supreme test. It is a test of our courage--of our resolve--of our wisdom--our essential democracy.

If we meet that test--successfully and honorably--we shall perform a service of historic importance which men and women and children will honor throughout all time.

As I stand here today, having taken the solemn oath of office in the presence of my fellow countrymen--in the presence of our God-- I know that it is America's purpose that we shall not fail.

In the days and in the years that are to come we shall work for a just and honorable peace, a durable peace, as today we work and fight for total victory in war.

We can and we will achieve such a peace.

We shall strive for perfection. We shall not achieve it immediately--but we still shall strive. We may make mistakes--but they must never be mistakes which result from faintness of heart or abandonment of moral principle.

I remember that my old schoolmaster, Dr. Peabody, said, in days that seemed to us then to be secure and untroubled: ""Things in life will not always run smoothly. Sometimes we will be rising toward the heights--then all will seem to reverse itself and start downward. The great fact to remember is that the trend of civilization itself is forever upward; that a line drawn through the middle of the peaks and the valleys of the centuries always has an upward trend.""

Our Constitution of 1787 was not a perfect instrument; it is not perfect yet. But it provided a firm base upon which all manner of men, of all races and colors and creeds, could build our solid structure of democracy.

And so today, in this year of war, 1945, we have learned lessons-- at a fearful cost--and we shall profit by them.

We have learned that we cannot live alone, at peace; that our own well-being is dependent on the well-being of other nations far away. We have learned that we must live as men, not as ostriches, nor as dogs in the manger.

We have learned to be citizens of the world, members of the human community.

We have learned the simple truth, as Emerson said, that ""The only way to have a friend is to be one."" We can gain no lasting peace if we approach it with suspicion and mistrust or with fear.

We can gain it only if we proceed with the understanding, the confidence, and the courage which flow from conviction.

The Almighty God has blessed our land in many ways. He has given our people stout hearts and strong arms with which to strike mighty blows for freedom and truth. He has given to our country a faith which has become the hope of all peoples in an anguished world.

So we pray to Him now for the vision to see our way clearly--to see the way that leads to a better life for ourselves and for all our fellow men--to the achievement of His will to peace on earth."
10002,"Clement Atlee, PM Inauguration Speech",https://www.cvce.eu/en/obj/address_given_by_clement_attlee_to_the_house_of_commons_15_march_1946-en-1c712462-349f-4319-9b3b-fadf8e198aad.html,Clement Atlee,Prime Minister (United Kingdom),Inauguration Speech,1945,,"The Prime Minister (Mr. Attlee): I would like to thank the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Saffron Walden (Mr. R. A. Butler) for his very helpful, wise, and constructive speech. He has, as we all know, given great service on Indian affairs for many years, and he comes of a family that has given many most distinguished public servants to India. I think that the tone in which he addressed the House is just what is needed today at this critical stage in the relationship between these two countries at a time, as has been said, of very high tension. I find from my Friends in this House who have been out to India and returned, from letters received from Indians, and from Englishmen in India of all points of view, complete agreement on the fact that India is today in a state of great tension and that this is indeed a critical moment. I am quite sure that everyone in this House realises the difficulties of the task which my right hon. Friends have undertaken in conjunction with the Viceroy, and that no one will desire to say anything whatever that will make their task more difficult. The right hon. Gentleman said that the Mission should go out in a positive mood. I entirely agree and that, indeed, is the mood in which my right hon. Friends are undertaking this Mission. It is a time emphatically for very definite and clear action.
I do not intend to make a long speech today, and I do not think it would be wise to do so. In particular, I think it would be most unhelpful to review the past. It is so easy to go back over the past and, in accordance with one’s predilections, apportion the blame for past failure in the long drawn out discussions there have been on this extraordinarily difficult problem – the problem of the development of India into a completely self-governing nation. Over such a long period of the past it is so easy to say that at this stage or at that stage opportunities were missed by the faults of one side or the other. I think also, as my right hon. Friend said, it would be a great mistake to stake out the claims of rival communities; we may be quite sure that will be done anyway.
I have had a fairly close connection with this problem now for nearly 20 years, and I would say there have been faults on all sides, but at this time we should be looking to the future rather than harking back to the past. This alone I would say to hon. Members, that it is no good applying the formulae of the past to the present position. The temperature of 1946 is not the temperature of 1920 or of 1930 or even of 1942. The slogans of an earlier day are discarded. Indeed, sometimes words that seemed at that time to Indians to express the height of their aspirations are now set on one side, and other words, other ideas, are substituted.
Nothing increases more the pace of the movement of public opinion than a great war. Everyone who had anything to do with this question in the early days between the wars knows what an effect the war of 1914-1918 had on Indian aspirations and Indian ideals. A tide which runs slowly in peace becomes in wartime vastly accelerated, and especially directly after a war, because that tide is to some extent banked up during the war.
I am quite certain that at the present time the tide of nationalism is running very fast in India and, indeed, all over Asia. One always has to remember that India is affected by what happens elsewhere in Asia. I remember so well, when I was on the Simon Commission, how it was borne in upon us what an effect the challenge that had been thrown out by Japan at that time had had on the Asiatic people. The tide of nationalism that at one time seemed to be canalised among a comparatively small proportion of the people of India – mainly a few of the educated classes – has tended to spread wider and wider. I remember so well, indeed, I think we put it in the Simon Commission Report, that although there were great differences in the expression of nationalist sentiment between what are called the extremists and the moderates, and although in many circumstances there might be such a stress on communal claims as might seem almost to exclude the conception of nationalism, yet we found that Hindu, Muslim, Sikh or Mahrattah, the politician or civil servant – among all of them that conception of nationalism had been growing stronger and stronger. Today I
think that national idea has spread right through and not least, perhaps, among some of those soldiers who have given such wonderful service in the war. I should like today, therefore, not to stress too much the differences between Indians. Let us all realise that whatever the difficulties, whatever the divisions may be, there is this underlying demand among all the Indian peoples.
The right hon. Gentleman did not suggest that the Government should publish any exact terms of reference of the Mission. We have set out the general purpose, and it is our intention that they should be given as free a hand as possible There will be matters, undoubtedly, on which it will be necessary to refer back for a Cabinet decision, but in the rather fluid position at the present time when we desire to get the utmost cooperation and good will between all the leaders of Indian opinion, it would be unwise to try to tie down those who are going out too rigidly. Indeed, the obvious reason for sending out Cabinet Ministers is that we send out persons of responsibility who are able to take decisions. Of course, there must be an area in which there may have to be a reference back.
The right hon. Gentleman stressed the great part India played during the war. It is worthwhile recording that twice in 25 years India has played a great part in the defeat of tyranny. Is it any wonder that today she claims – as a nation of 400,000,000 people that has twice sent her sons to die for freedom – that she should herself have freedom to decide her own destiny? My colleagues are going to India with the intention of using their utmost endeavours to help her to attain that freedom as speedily and fully as possible. What form of Government is to replace the present regime is for India to decide; but our desire is to help her to set up forthwith the machinery for making that decision. There we are met sometimes with the initial difficulty of getting that machinery set up. We are resolved that machinery shall be set up and we seek the utmost cooperation of all Indian leaders to do so.
The right hon. Gentleman quoted the statement that had been made with regard to India's future. India herself must choose what will be her future Constitution; what will be her position in the world. I hope that the Indian people may elect to remain within the British Commonwealth. I am certain that she will find great advantages in doing so. In these days that demand for complete, isolated nationhood apart from the rest of the world, is really outdated. Unity may come through the United Nations, or through the Commonwealth, but no great nation can stand alone without sharing in what is happening in the world. But if she does so elect, it must be by her own free will. The British Commonwealth and Empire is not bound together by chains of external compulsion. It is a free association of free peoples. If, on the other hand, she elects for independence, in our view she has a right to do so. It will be for us to help to make the transition as smooth and easy as possible.
We should be conscious that the British have done a great work in India. We have united India and given her that sense of nationality which she so very largely lacked over the previous centuries. She has learned from us principles of democracy and justice. When Indians attack our rule, they base their attack, not on Indian principles, but on the basis of standards derived from Britain. I was very struck the other day in the United States, at a dinner where I met a number of distinguished Americans, including a very distinguished Indian, where the talk was turning on the way in which principles worked out here have been applied on the continent of America. It was pointed out that America had a great heritage from Britain. My Indian friend said to me, “You know, the Americans sometimes forget there is another great nation that has also inherited these principles and traditions, and that is India. We feel that we have a duty, a right and a privilege because we also bring to the world and work those very principles that you evolved in Britain.”
I am well aware, when I speak of India, that I speak of a country containing a congeries of races, religions and languages, and I know well all the difficulties thereby created. But those difficulties can only be overcome by Indians. We are very mindful of the rights of minorities and minorities should be able to live free from fear. On the other hand, we cannot allow a minority to place a veto on the advance of the majority.
We cannot dictate how these difficulties may be overcome. Our first duty is to get the machinery of decision set up. That is the main purpose of my hon. Friends and the Viceroy. We also want to see set up an interim Government. One of the purposes of the Bill which has been discussed today is to give the Viceroy a greater freedom in order that in the period that shall elapse while this Constitution is being worked out, we may have a Government commanding the greatest possible support in India. I would not like to fetter the Viceroy’s discretion in any way, with regard to the allocation of portfolios.
There were a number of points my right hon. Friend mentioned with which I should like to deal. There is the problem of the Indian States. In many Indian States great advances have been made in democratic institutions, and a most interesting experiment is now going forward in Travancore, under the guidance of the distinguished statesman, Sir C. P. Ramaswari Aiyar. Of course, the feelings in British India in regard to nationalism and the unity of India cannot be confined by the boundaries that separate these States from the Provinces. I hope that the statesmen of British India and of princely India will be able to work out a solution of the problem of bringing together, in one great polity, these disparate constituent parts. There again, we must see that the Indian States find their due place; there can be no positive veto on advance, and I do not believe for a moment that the Indian princes would desire to be a bar to the forward march of India. But, as in the case of any other problems, this is a matter that Indians will settle themselves.
I am very well aware, as we all are, of the minority problems in India, and I think that Indian leaders are more and more realising the need for settling them if India is to have a smooth passage in future years. I believe that due provision will be made for that in the Constitution, and my right hon. Friends, in their conversations, will certainly not neglect the point. We must, however, recognise that we cannot make Indians responsible for governing themselves and, at the same time, retain over here responsibility for the treatment of minorities and the power to intervene on their behalf. We are mindful, too, I can assure the right hon. Gentleman, of the position of the Services – the men who have done great service to India – and the position of their families. I think India should be sensible of the responsibility she has towards those who have served her, and I think that a Government which takes over, so to speak, the assets of our Government will also have to take over the liabilities. There again, that is a point to be dealt with later on. It does not concern the immediate purpose of setting up what I have called the instrument of decision. I entirely agree with what the right hon. Gentleman said with regard to the Treaty. That Treaty is primarily for India. We are not going to hang out for anything for our own advantage which would be a disadvantage to India.
In conclusion, may I stress again the crucial nature of the task before us? This problem is of vital importance not only to India and the British Commonwealth and Empire, but to the world. There is this immense nation, set in the midst of Asia, an Asia which has been ravaged by war. Here we have the one great country that has been seeking to apply the principles of democracy. I have always hoped myself that politically India might be the light of Asia. It is a most unfortunate circumstance that, just at the time when we have to deal with these great political issues, there should be grave economic difficulties and, in particular, very grave anxiety over India’s food supply. The House knows that His Majesty’s Government are deeply concerned in this problem, and my right hon. Friend the Minister of Food is at the present time in the United States with an Indian delegation. We shall do our utmost to help her. At the present moment I do not think I should say anything on the social and economic difficulties to which the right hon. Gentleman referred except this: I believe that those economic and social difficulties can only be solved by the Indians themselves, because they are so closely bound up with the whole Indian way of life and outlook. Whatever we can do to assist, we shall do. My right hon. Friends are going out to India resolved to succeed and I am sure everyone will wish them “God speed.”"

It is a very high ‘position high you occupy and it is a very difficu]t positien, In order to succeed, and 1 am sure you will succeed, YOU will bave need of a11 your qualities. YOU wilf be firm without intransigeance; you ~21 be conciliatory without wcakness; you will be impartial without exception. You are at the present moment the most highly quahfied representative of the international spidt. May 1 be allowed to give you a word of advice, and that is that in your direction of the Unir;ed Nations Organization, without ever compromising the ideal which we have set before ourselves as the end of a11 our eff arts, you should never lose contact with reality. We are neither a learned society nor an academy; we are a great political and social organization, and for us reality counts. It is the raw material of our work. And you should seek the force and the power of your influence, not in ‘any theoretical idealism, but in an cptimistic confidence founded on facts. 1 have no doubts about you. You belong to one of those northern countries in which democracy has happily developed in order and prosperity, in which the most generous and the most just ideas and the bold ones have become living realities. You belong to a courageous, fierce and proud people, which was certainly demonstrated during the war; but they are also a reasonable and practical people. Of that people you are one of the greatest sons. Those who lived near you during the war know your courtesy and your high-mindedness. They have confidence in you, and soon, 1 feel sure, the whole world will ratify that judgment. Therefore 1 say to you: Good courage and good luck, Mr. Secretary-General, and may 1 be allowed to add: Good courage and good luck, my dear friend.  Ladies and gentlemen, I dcclare Mr. Lie installed in his functions as Secretary-General.
(The saven Vice-Presidents of the General Assembly, the President of the Security Council
and the President of the Economie and Social Council each congratulated MT. Lie on bis a!-
pointment as Secretary-GsneraE.) The PRESIDENT (TransEation from the French) :. 1 cal1 upon Mr. Lie to deliver his first speech as Secretary-General. <tp I” Mr. LIE (Secretary-General) : May 1 first of all express my thanks to the President of the Assembly for his kind words to me and to my counwYou will readily understand my feelings on this occasion. 1 am filled with gratitude toward YOU ail for the honour you bave paid me by electing me your Secretary-General. 1 a& YOU to accept my most sincere thanks. It is naturally with deep emotion that 1 leave the service of my country and my King and enter the service of the international community as a whole. I am profoundly impressed Tby the serious nature of the task ahead of me. I kncw that the &Charge of my new duties will demand of me everything 1 shall be able to give. 

In embarking on my great task, however, I am comforted by the knowledge that, first, the Executive Committee, then the Preparatory Commission and now the General Assembly have smoothed my path by working out in consideratbla detail the organization and procedures of the principal organs of the United Nations, including the Secretariat, of which I shall be Head. I am more grateful than I can express that so much preliminary work has been done and that such a wide measure of agreement has been reached on so many complex issues. 

I am comforted, too, in the knowledge that I shall, from the outset, have a competent and experienced temporary staff at my disposal. I am greatly impressed by the work of Mr. Jebb and his colleagues and I am most anxious that they should stay with me until I have had the time to plan the establishment of my permanent staff. For this reason, I am glad that the General Assembly has authorized me to invite the members of the Secretariat of the Preparatory Commission to continue to serve the United Nations until 1 April.

In taking over my new task, I promise you to do my best. I am the servant of you all. You can count upon my impartial approach to all your problems. I am determined to merit your further confidence through my work for the cause of the United Nations. Certain of your support, I look to the future with confidence. It will be my duty as always to act as a true international officer, inspired by the same lofty idea of international co-operation which prompted our great leaders of the last war in taking the initiative in the creation of the United Nations.

Your Secretary-General is not called upon to formulate the policy of the United Nations. The lines of that policy are laid down in the Charter and determined by decisions of the different relevant organs of the United Nations. The task of the Secretariat will be to assist all those organs of the United Nations in preparing and carrying out all decisions taken by them in order to make the policy programme of the Charter a living reality.

The purpose of the United Nations is the maintenance of peace in the atmosphere of international security and general well-being. One of the main duties ofyour Secretariat must be to assist the Security Council in every possible way in the fulfilment of its mission.

But there is a close connexion between the peace problem and the economic and social conditions of the countries of the world. The creation of better economic and social conditions for all peoples is one of the principal aims of the United Nations. I wish to emphasize that everything within the competence and capacity of the Secretariat will be done to enable the Economic and Social Council to perform its functions.

In all this work the Secretariat will remember the suffering and devastation caused by the war. Vast millions of our fellow men live in a state of despirate misery and privation. Food, housing, clothing and hcat must be provided for them, and this can only be achieved in a democratic and peaceful world.

Another important duty of the Secretariat will be to assist the Trusteeship Council in its great task to further the progressive development of the Trust Territories towards self-government or independence.

I am happy to welcome you and offer you my best wishes for the success of our proceedings. Since San Francisco, the wisest among us have very often, and with good reason, expressed their satisfaction at seeing Soviet Russia and the United States of America, in contrast to what used to happen after the last war, taking their place among us and playing an active part. And now here is the United States welcoming us on its own soil. Here we are, for the first time, the 51 nations who make up our Organisation, meeting together there. For that reason alone, 23 October 1946 is a historic date. May it be the start of a long period of understanding, cooperation and peace among nations! How proud it makes me to be able to speak for you and tell the men and women of this country about the feelings we have for them, to express the admiration we feel for their passion for work, their genius for organisation, their technology and the prosperity which, thanks to them, reigns over their enormous country. But I would also, in particular, like to mention the gratitude, the thankfulness we owe them for having twice in 25 years deliberately put all their wealth at risk and, through the sacrifice of so many of their children, helped so powerfully to save freedom in the world. They were democracy’s arsenal and soon became what was certainly the most powerful part of its army. And we who saw them in our towns and cities, on our roads, in the countryside, rushing to protect us and liberate us, we who have piously kept thousands and thousands of them in our cemeteries, we who know what a joyful, strong, brave nation they are, we are asking them today to help us build peace just as they helped us win the war. Our appeal is not just a selfish appeal: if they respond, it is also, for those who are alive, a way of keeping faith with their dead. Your presence here, Mr President, is telling evidence of the importance the people of the United States attach to our work. So it is not only a great honour, for which we thank you, it is in itself a reason for trust and hope. At what was still a very difficult period of the war, you succeeded to a post held by one of the greatest men of modern times. You were the friend and associate of President Roosevelt and you are, I am sure, the faithful interpreter of his thinking in honouring this first meeting of ours with your presence. Allow us, as we greet you, to extend the tribute we pay you to the great figure of your predecessor and to express the wish that in future, at all times and whoever they may be, the Presidents of the United States will follow the magnificent path of understanding, clear-sightedness and international generosity opened up by Franklin Delano Roosevelt. That was the kind of atmosphere in which they started working. In his report, so sincere and for that very reason so interesting, the Secretary-General has not attempted to hide the fact that we have not so far, as he puts it, succeeded in capturing, as we should have done, the imagination and awakening the enthusiasm of the world’s peoples. What a golden opportunity, wouldn’t you agree, for the sceptics, the pessimists, the deniers to say: ‘Well, what did we tell you!’ All the more reason for us, gentlemen, not to be discouraged but to redouble our efforts, correct our mistakes and improve. There are people who cast doubts about what we do, make jokes about it and, pointing to what is difficult, complicated and, of necessity, less than perfect in what we do, are already announcing that we have failed. Have they actually thought about what that would mean? Have they anything to suggest instead of the United Nations? And have they failed to grasp that the dilemma is a simple one: either we succeed or the world will sink back into disorder, chaos and finally war. If that is the alternative, then I think we are fully justified in persevering. Some day in the future, the pessimists may be right for all I know, but I do know that today they are wrong. In San Francisco, they said that the Charter could never be drafted. In London, they said that the Organisation could never be brought to life. Over the last few weeks, they were saying that we would not meet again and now, no doubt, they are saying that we will tear each other to shreds. The Charter has been ratified; the Organisation is working. We are here and we are going to work. Let us try to work well. Working well does not necessarily mean talking a lot. It means having an effective method for achieving practical results — results, something tangible and positive! That is what our people are attentively and anxiously expecting of us. Let us avoid overly lengthy general discussions, speeches better suited to propaganda than to enlightening those who disagree with us, endless bickering over procedure. Let us address the issues squarely, quickly and bravely. Most of all, let us address them in the right spirit. The more I think about it, the more experience I accumulate, the more I come to this conclusion: what we must create and nurture is a genuine, living international spirit. As long as we sincerely, deep down, fail to be convinced that, for better or worse, the 51 of us are no more than a single human community, we will not be able to achieve our aims. This international spirit we so badly need is not something we will acquire straight away. Like all great things, it can only be the reward of a long effort. To acquire it, we must first practise the virtue of understanding. Our aims are the same and in our heart of hearts we are all, I am quite sure, seeking the good and the happiness of the peoples we represent. Our reflexes, though, our ways of thinking and debating will not always be exactly the same. There are differences between us in terms of race and mentality; our immediate interests are sometimes actually contradictory. Those are obstacles that it would be foolish and even dangerous to disregard. But there is no obstacle which cannot be overcome by generosity, intelligence and pressing need. We all have our faults and our virtues. Understanding each other means, first of all, enriching ourselves. In the difficult task we face, the press has an enormous part to play. On it depends, I think, in the final analysis, the success or the failure of our endeavours. When it comes down to it, it is the press which reports what we say. Every morning and every evening, it comments on our words and our deeds for millions and millions of our fellow humans. The way it sees us is how we end up appearing. In times like these when diplomacy is conducted in public, the objectivity of the press, its sense of proportion, its awareness of the part it plays and the enormous responsibilities it bears can be decisive. I call on it to do us a great service: let it agree not to pointlessly make a drama out of our discussions, even when passions run high; let it, insofar as is humanly possible, drop the sensational side of the news it reports and, instead, be a powerful, active agent of mutual understanding. Most of all, let it not depict any statesman who seeks conciliation and accepts compromises as a weak statesman. That is why we are here, let it not forget: to seek and find the point of balance between our respective interests. We will never find our way there if we fail to grasp that there is almost always something legitimate in the other person’s point of view and then refuse to take it into account. To fight and win the war, we had to rely on everyone to help. We need to do the same to build the peace. Let our peoples be resolute but patient. Let the journalists who keep them informed be active but objective. Let the statesmen who lead them be firm but show understanding. How many virtues we will have to possess, gentlemen, if we are to succeed! The object to be achieved is noble enough, great enough, fine enough, it seems to me, to inspire us, to force us to surpass ourselves! Let us, to support and encourage our endeavours, think of the reward that awaits us if we can prove equal to the task we have to perform and succeed in bringing the world that peace which it deserves after so much suffering and so many sacrifices. Gentlemen, let us buckle down to the work with confidence."
10019,"Oswaldo Aranha, PGA Inauguration Speech",https://undocs.org/en/A/PV.136,Oswaldo Aranha,President of the General Assembly,Inauguration Speech,1947,,"In opening the third session of the General Assembly, the TEMPORARY PRESIDENT stated that the task was an honour for his Government. In that way, it iell to Argentina to offer the first expression of thought in that solemn assembly of nations whose desire it was to find a way of realizing the hope of universal harmony on a road beset with difficulties. Historical destiny, shaped by human agency, had willed that that great meeting should be held in the immortal land of France, to whose clear-sighted spirit the world owed a revolution of universal import, which had embodied the desires and fears of an epoch and by its reper cussions on the life and history of the nations, sometimes through support, sometimes through opposition, had inspired new and promising forms of co-operation which were destined to promote harmony, peace and progress in the world. Argentina, which through at its honourable history, had given visible expression to its peace ful sentiments, its respect for the rights of man, its faith in the spontaneous fulfilment of its duties and its fidelity to total democracy, saluted the eternal France, spirited and tumultuous, lively and full of genius, which through periods of distress had continued to renew its belief in justice. Argentina saluted also all the peoples of the world who were the cradles of political ideas, eager to put an end to anxiety and unrest by the establishment of a universal system in which unhappiness and distress would be impossible. Argentina had inherited the previous legacy of Greco-Latin culture and bad built up its fundamental institutions under the moral in fluence of the Holy Writ, and in contact with the very roots of Spanish civilization, the fruitful work and gerius of the Italians and the magni ficent humanism of the French. Argentina belonged to a continent fighting against a poverty which was inexplicable in the midst of abundance, a continent striving in a peaceable and creative spirit to direct the forces of human anxiety towards the creation of inter national understanding. It was a continent whose nations believed in the future, perhaps because their famous ancestors had nobly struggled to achieve the miracle of a penco de signed to endure. Such were Washington and Jefferson, Juarez, Marti and Morelos, Miranda and Bolivar, Tiradentes, O'Higgins and San Martin, men who had worked for freedom, order, work, love and justice. In view of all that, it seemed impossible that the world should continue to live in trouble and conflict. The desire of nations, governments and peoples to establish a legal system capable of preventing war, humanity's most terrible evil, was understandable. Nevertheless, the peoples, facing anxiety and noting the distressing appearance of new dilli culties before previous ones had been resolved, were speculating daily as to the averting or outbreak of a new conflict, which, like a modern Leviathan, would destroy material progress and devour age-old civilizations. And so, bewildered, the peoples asked whether it was necessary to have a universal legal system, static or dynamic, to regulate relations between the peoples, whether it was also essential to have an organization, static or dynamic, to apply and carry out the ruler drawn up to regulate the world order. Or, in the light of humanity's successive failures and the growing scepticism of the massee, must it be believed that man was biologically incapable of peace Humanity's problems were numerous and terrible. Faith and optimism must be abun dantly inspired in order to give life and renewed strength. Man had to turn his thoughts to the centuries when there were born nations whose beginnings had been lost to history and to teaching; he must turn his thoughts towards civilizations forged in fierce and constant strise and remember that progress was imperceptible and advanced but slowly with the centuries. The Tomporary President said that he did not, of course, refer to material progress, which Was faster and more evident and displayed the obvious material complexity of life. For those reasons, perhaps, it might be necessary as a first step to organize governments of complete sim plicity but of supreme wisdom, and in the fight between matter and spirit, to stand by the spirit, which put the seal of dignity on humanity For that reason, in the establishment of a legal system of peace-making the use of force would have to bo avoided, for even if peace were to be achieved by such means, history, which should always be read, considered and recalled, proved the precariouaneas of results thug achieved. Nor was it possible for obvious reasons to contemplate the establishment of a world State contrary to the essence of those cristing national Sovereiguities on which the social structure of the nations rested. The international com munity could only be seriously considered in its present form, which was a combination of rules for the establishment batween peoples of such a link of legal conscience as would allow fulfil mnent of humanity's desire for peace and of its lasting hope for life under the protection of standards of justice. An exnmination of the Preamble and the pur proses and principles of the United Nations Charter, as well as its underlying moral and legal principles could not but satisfy the most exacting minds. The desire for protection against the scourgo of war, faith in the fundamental rights and freedoms of the human person, complete achievement of justice, friendship, tolerance, co-operation, mutual respect, equality between States, good faith, the pacific settlement of dis putes, were in fact excellent ideals, strong enough in themselves to create or strengthen convictions and slates of conscience. There was thus an ethical and juridical world system and man had, or believed he had, the appropriate machinery to achieve it fully. Never theless, uneasiness and insecurity among the nations were unmistakably apparent In different countries and in verying tones, the masses were commenting upon the indecision, the absence of solutions, the outbreak of con flicts, the reign of mistrust, the distressing dis harmony, in the midst of which there moved that vast organization established by the nations to regulate and organize a sincere and permanent poice, to resolve present or future difficulties, to avert conflicts, to inspire confidence and to direct and harmonize the world's material and spiritual forces. Were those the signs of a crisis in the estab lished legal or functional system which the nations had established? Or was it only a break down of confidence due to circumstances? Per haps both aspects were worth considering. For it was not enough to set up a system; the system must be equipped with all th elements which made it capable of improvement if it were to function effectively. Nor was it enough – and that was the essential point - to set up a system; the system must be believed in and not violated. For all those reasons, it was clear that more attention must be given to the reconciliation of aims which, however numerous and complex they might be, however contrary to what might be called biological fatalism , none the less Tequired a solid moral basis. It was a question of creating quite new states of popular fooling, capable of attacking the cause of the evils in their remotest strongholds; of a victory of altruistic and generous sentiments; of the defeat of utilitarianism and egotism. of populla questidoral basis."" The Members of the United Nations had met to build, to renew permanently and conscien tiously, and to realize the juridical dynamism needed for the perennial transformation of life, and not statically to contemplate the tremendous burning problems of disagreement. The peoples wanted to know what was going on so that they could make a substantial contri bution to the solution of problems, in accordance with that feeling for justice which was inherent in the human scul. They did not want any more hatred and destruction; they necred the creative prevalence of love. That Organization must be a universal com munity which, side by side with the regional organizations, would function organically and harmoniously in the interests of world peace. At the present time, it was not reasonable to suppose that it was within the power of a group of nations to assure the independence of the remaining countries of the world. Peace was not in fact the result of a social contract, although it might be so in principle. It should not be the subject of a single or common document. Either it must be built among all countries or there would be no social equilibrium. The invidious exclusion of nations was a grave error. The reasons were obvious; they were based not only on simple moral judgments but also on circumstancos linked with tho general interest. Moreover, it was an unquestionable truth, which even dogmatic dialectics could not deny, that if universal peaco were really desired, in order to build human happiness on that majestic foundation, it was necessary to find the truth itself in order to proclaim it; it was absolutely essential to trust, tolerate, respect, understand and love, in order that truth, confidence, to.e rance, respect, understanding and love might be created and prevail. Argentina did not want any nation of the world to be excluded from the United Nations. There could be no chosen and no outcasts in the world, for all were human beings and, as such, had rights and duties. Moreover, Argentina believed that there should be a reconsideration of practices expressive of a hierarchy of States in the direction of the Organization and the establishment of its general lines of policy and that not only because that et hierarchy was contrary to the democratic attitude deriving from tho juridical equality of Stutes but because it placed the fate of all peoples in the hands of a few nations. And Argentina did not want anyone to decide the fate of peoples without their own participation so that they might have satisfaction in success and consolation in failure. That was not said to belittle those who had fought for ideals which they held to be good and which history would finally judge, for there had been too many victims, too much suffering and ruin, disaster and pain to warrant abstract and useless comments. His statement had been made for the benefit of both small and great nations, ud mere for the latter than for the former, for if the lessons of history were noted, the great nations had been more often the victims of disa greement and of wars than the small. First, there were threats; then, acts of aggression; then, anarchy: all of which sacrificed the duties and rights of man. Argentina wanted now, without further delay, to contribute to the survival of a world free from subjection. It was confident that, after the critical hours which had passed and those which might still come, there would be a respite which would allow a clearer expression of the feeling of solidarity among those nations which desired understanding The nations had expressed their views clearly und resonantly. There could be no nations that were enemies of peace. For that reason, the appeal launched by the United Nations would be all the more pressing. The republican life of the nations must be endowed with the purest democratie feeling. Justice must also be applied in the most posi= tive manner so that all questions arising within the United Nations might be solved by the simple formulae of roason. The problems confronting humanity today were no longer the problems of war, but of peace. They were problems which always arose after the end of hostilities. The world therefore needed unity in order to face in common the study of all those questions which might arise throughout the most varied fields. None of them could be subordinated to the interosts of certain countries or groups of countries, but must be subordinated to the interest of all in roaching a common and lasting destiny. America had understood that, for if it appeared united in the eyes of history, it was because it wished its rights and its legitimate aspirations to be respected, and because it also placed its whole future at the service of all the constructive forces in the world. That was exemplified in an instructive manner in the history of the first half of the twentieth century. The lessons of history should not in any case discourage nations. They should, on the con trary, be a stimulant to the complete establish ment of peace through the conclusion of agree ments which would end conflicts. Respect for the individual was the basic moral aim of democracy. The nations of America openly proclaimed that aim, as did also their constitutions. Democracy was not the exclusive privilege of certain chosen peoples. It was a stage of development which all might claim. Its social, ecunomic and political principles were at the service of the admirable ideal of equality of opportunity, by which every man know where he might begin and had in himself the possi bility of working out his own destiny with the guarantee of essential freedoms, provided by the State for the defence of the individual. That was why democracy was not only a posi tive fact but was also capable of being perfected. Every step forward blazed the trail towards the perfect society and towards the betterment of man's position in it. The nations represented in the United Nations were democratic members of an essentially democratic world. In it there was not only equality of opportunity but also the maximum of opportunity, and in it nothing was taken from the individual and nothing was subtracted from the nation. The democratic spirit stimulating the individual was the spirit which inspired his country of origin. Thus loyalty to democracy meant firm support for the institutions serving the democratic ideal. The sole purpose of existence within the frame work of such institutions should be to enable man to reach a state of economic freedom and political independence. That, in the opinion of the Argentine dele gation, was the true meaning of democracy, the direct result of which was the advancement within society of the dignity of the human person, The nations had progressively rejected, when over necessary, the seizure of political power by élites, whether in the form of mob violence or of ambiguous interpretations of the views of the ruling class. In every case, the people, by demonstrating the true nature of democratic society, had broken the fetters laid upon them and brought to an end the excessive brutality of the regimes or the quasi-mystical superstitions of their oppressors. Nations had a natural preference for freedom of action, for they understood that that was the only method of attaining their material and spiritual potentialities. There were passionate debates as to whether economics were more important than politics or vice versa. It was idle to attempt to solve that problem by purely dialectical definitions. Both factors should rather be given their relative importance in international relations. The United Nations was putting into practice a form of social economy in which capital served the economic systent, and not the reverse, becalise, when viewed in the international aspect, that form better served the co-operative interests which were its sourc. In order, however, that such a conception might be effective in practice, it was essential to promote the production of raw materials, to consider the allocation of surpluses on an equi table basis, to seek and achieve a balance between the prices of raw materials and of industrial products, to promote increased industrialization of certain countries, and, in short, to create an economy based upon abundance and co-opera tion by full utilization of all the resources of the universe. In the political field, the Uaited Nations be lieved in the supremacy of morality and law. It did not believe that force could create right when that force was on the side of oppression and injustice. Wherever force prevailed, only dumb subservience, virtual slavery, resulted. Wherever right founded on morality prevailed, that solidarity which made for harmony was achieved. Force resulted only in subjection, owing to the absence of the factors that might induce moral conviction. At the same time it gave rise to divisions, hatred and the secret desire for revenge. Wherever force was put to the service of coercion, the moral and legal principles of the Charter gave way to unrealizable abstractions. That way of thinking seemed utopian at the present time, wat because web u ideal was unattainable, but because humanity had not yet freed itself from the egoism which blinded it to every possibility of seeing, hearing or reason ing. The Argentine delegation would, how ever, declare once more-perhaps in vain, but with the conviction that it was right that force as an instrument claiming to create law must be ban ished and that there could only be belief in the force of morality and law as the foundation of universal harmony and lasting peace. Now that the United Nations was defending the rights of States and working for economic liberation within the framework of the loftiest principles of freedom and order, it should once again lay stress on the means of organizing pro gress. The world could not be a dialogue between two nations, and certainly not a monologue by one of them. The total solution would come from reconciliation of the conflicting points of view of all nations. The President of Argentina, who had intro duced measures which had placed his people in the vanguard of progress in social and democratic matters had assigned to him the signal honour of conveying to the representatives of the Mem bers of the United Nations his message of good will and peace. General Peron's ideals coincided completely with the deepest feelings of the Argentine people; they were in harmony with the humanitarian and Americanist, traditions of that country. Consequently his words were all the more significant and weighty. The President of Argentina had expressed himself in the following words, which he, the representative of Argentina, was happy to repeat before the United Nations : The dark events of this vexed post-war period afford us the consolation of giving ample scope to our spirit of international solidarity. Argen tina reaches out to the most remote countries, but not merely as a trading nation, it lends generous help by converting its production into an instrument for peace. Argentina does not use its economic power to exercise pressure in international relations. Its ships bring a mes sage of understanding between the peoples, of peace between the nations and respect among States. We can say that we go with open arms to meet all the peoples of the earth and say to them : Banish hatred, set your minds at rest and fortify your spirit. May the sorrows you have endured serve not to breed vengeance and new strength to your arm, but to calm the violence of the past. Our hearts filled with love, we wish that you might share our desire for peace, and that that desire might leave, wherever it was felt, goodwill in its wake. We have the right to speak thus because, al though weare ready to defend, passionately, our honour, our homes, our soil and our country, we shall never cause anxiety to others or threaten the peace of other peoples. We respect all others in so far as they respect us. We love all others to the extent to which they share our senti ments. Thus we are against no one and opposed to no system. Argentina is no one's enemy, nor does it discriminate according to ideas, race or religion. All it desires is that its traditional way of life should be respected, and I am sure all we Argentines will agree with that senti ment. Argentina wants to remain what it has always been, and will never tolerate attempts to divert it from its way of thought, its senti ments and its actions, Such were the words of peace spoken by President Peron. Every Argentinean shared in the action into which those lofty sentiments had been trans lated. Working in unison, they were endea vouring to achieve stability and good order at home, to strengthen the factors for international peace through mutual respect, legal equality and economic collaboration which would conso lidate those political bonds between States and that social justice which were the obvious found ations for the happiness of the nations. There were many nations which had already taken up their stand on the historic plan which the world was endeavouring to carry out, as though this were a political necessity or as though any champion of progress were obliged to draw a dividing line between those who desired to achieve that progress and those who, because they had not reached the goal in good time, tried instead to drag the world down towards sorrow and affliction. War, culminating point of misuuderstanding, could not be either the goal of hope or the fatal outcome of despair. The nations of the world should therefore be induced, not to give further encouragement to latent warlike forces, but on the contrary to demonstrate the advantages to humanity of finding in lasting peace the solution of its pro blems and in hard work the means of achieving progress. Humanity must work in peace. That was what all peoples desired, even those who might seem most warlike. That was the guiding idea of the American countries, and especially of Argentina, which would always stress that, though some groups might be dragged into war, the world could still remain at peace. Could it be that the stakes in that gigantic struggle were the domination of the universe and the enslavement of man? It was inconceivable that no agreement could be reached on a political action whick embodied the sentiment of millions, an action which would be basically democratic - in the social sphere, the proclamation of justice, in the economic sphere a trend towards a free social economy. In that field of human contention, would it not be possible to find some basis of agreement between the groups already classed as atago nistic, which many countries regarded as drawing ever closer to an armed struggle? The gap dividing them had been narrowing ever since the great victory over the totalitarian armies. Today it would seem that a new and frightful human conflict was even more imminent than at the end of the second world war. In the search for a methodical and progressive solution, removed from the warmongering in fluences of the various camps, a group of nations was working out the salvation of man in a true and profound spirit of freedom. A policy of peace should be the overriding policy of the world. The prevalence of injustice often affected an existing state of peace. The absence of ideals of social and economic stability could lead to disturbances and unrest, the cause and development of which could be justified. If all that were the outcome of the itaperfection of life, or of attompts to achieve a desired perfec tion, peace would be the common denominator of all those efforts. Measures should therefore be taken to make the existence of men and of States more secure, thus directing all energies towards a collaboration which would be possuive and human, sound and protective, and to attain a world peace which would exclude the possibility of the continued existence of war and of extremes of poverty and plenty, on whatever side they might be found. Man had to realize that it was impossible always to live on the principle of the historic inevitability of war. The rights of man, proclaimed by all peoples, had, from their outset, co-ordinated progress and enabled civilization to become more stable. With the advent of peace, mankind too must achieve harmony and find its permanent roots in its own progress and emancipation. Fundamental respect for the sovereignty of nations, economic co-operation in the recovery of needy countries and of those which, without having suffered directly in the recent conflict, were also poverty-stricken, and the fusion of the efforts of all men the world over for the setting-up of a permanent peace, so that they might move about freely without hindrances of a political or social nature, without economic enslavement and enjoying full cultural opportunities, would all combine to form a noble charter which mankind could not give up. In spite of geographical differences, of the dis parities in size of territories, of the varying sizes of populations, races and economic resources, large and small nations were equal where justice was concerned. ndividual, 5 strong, so, milar had to selves once It was essential to grasp that fact, but in itself that was not sufficient. It was necessary to organize the relationships of one country with another so that they should be really equal. As in private law where a legal authority had been established in favour of the economically weak individual, giving him equal rights with the economically strong, so, within the organization of nations, something similar had to be set up. Otherwise nations would find themselves once again confronted with the rayth of the legal equality of States, of the liberty and sovereignty of nations, while they would in fact be handi capped and hampered by the great Powers' desire for expansion. Argentina's position was based upon truth, sovereignty and justice. Only truth could guide the peoples, because it was immortal and was one of the fundamental attributes of human society. In order that the solidarity of nations might become a reality, it was essential for each people to have its own individuality by achieving its own way of life, the free development of its home policy, the full possession of its territory, and complete liberty to organize its economy, its culture, its language and its religion, by means, in short, of all those aspects of life which resulted from the full and complete rocognition of the legal personality of States. Without sovereignty, there could be no liberty: without liberty, there could be no personality and, without personality, the solidarity of nations was impossible. All that, however, demanded the full realiza tion of those ideals of justice whose conception had not varied from the times of Plato to the present day, any more than had the harmony of the soul with itself, the sound order and co ordination of its various parts, and the practice of gi.ing every man his due, of preferring what seemed to be just, of obeying the law in all cir cumstances, of preferring equality in the com munity of nations, and of obeying the dynamic force of the laws which created life itself. The hopes of all humanity rested in that organ ization of States, from which a regulation of international policy was expected on which all nations could base theinselves. Those nations hoped that the various countries would direct their policies towards co-operation and not towards domination. They hoped that from that organization there would emerge a concept which would ensure that in the world there would no longer be extremes of wealth and poverty among nations, and that in the settle ment of disputes, right would prevail over might. It was Argentina's desire to see the realization of those aims, which were of such vital importance in the interests of peace. The representative of Argentina had stressed his country's ideals as they were the very essence of the spirit of his country, because it was a country whose flag had stood for liberty and never for conquest, and also because it was in that country that the words filled with the spirit of love : America for humanity, had been uttered. He would call upon all representatives present to reflect and to work for peace. They must not lose a single moment and act in such a way that that General Assembly would be remembered as a meeting where universal understanding and friendship had prevailed. Let it be a symboi of tution and not of disagreement. Union would the better serve the cause of peace when en nobled by virtue. "
10026,"Herbert Vere Evatt, PGA Closing Address",http://undocs.org/en/A/PV.219,José Arce,President of the General Assembly,Inauguration Speech,1948,,"The SECRETARy-GENERAL said that the longest session of the General Assembly in the history of the United Nations was finally drawing to a close. He wished first to pay tribute to the President, Mr. Evatt, who had been a courageous leader of the United Nations and had greatly strengthened the cause of peace by the way in which he had upheld the interests of the Organization. Next he wished to thank the members of the Secretariat who had discharged a difficult duty loyally. Their work had been made especially difficult on more than one occasion during the third session. He expressed his complete confidence in the Secretariat and he believed they should have understanding, recognition and support in their position of impartiality from all delegations. Finally, he wished to express his thanks to the representatives for the progress towards peace that had been made by Member Governments during the third session of the General Assembly. The session had opened in an atmosphere of crisis and profound fear. When it had adjourned temporarily in December 1948, the sense of crisis had been eased, but fear and discouragement had remamed. At the close of the session, hopes for peace were brighter and faith in the United Nations was stronger than it had been for a long time. M~lCh had been said about the history of the Berlm blockade, but the Secretary-General wished to draw attention to another aspect of the matter because he thought that the history of the consideration of the Berlin crisis in the United Nations illustrated very well what he would call the United Nations way to peace. When three of the five great Powers had brought a complaint (S/1020, S/1020/Add.l) against a fourth great Power in the Security Council in September 1948, fears of war and of the destruction of the United Nations had been general,1 Nevertheless, the forces of moderation and conciliation had set to work immediately. In the Security Council a draft resolution (S/1048) embodying a formula for peaceful settlement had been introduced.2 It had not secured the necessary unanimity,s but that had not ended the peace efforts. The so-called neutrals on the Security Council had carried on uncler the splendid leadership of the Argentine Foreign Minister, Mr. Bramuglia. A study of the Berlin currency question had been undertaken and, although the report on that subject had not been accepted when it had been submitted to the four great Powers during the past winter, it might perhaps prove helpful during the negotiations which were shortly to be held in Paris. During the first part of the third session, the General Assembly had unanimously adopted resolution 190 (Ill), introduced by Mexico, appealing to the great Powers to renew their efforts to compose their differences and establish a lasting peace. The great Powers had been asked to act on that resolution in November 1948, and although the attempt hacl then been unavailing, that had not ended the peace efforts. At Lake Success,in February 1949, the first informal conversations hacl taken place between representatives of the United States and the USSR. It had been by United Nations representatives in United Nations delegation offices that those conversations had been brought to their successful conclusion. As a result, the blockade had been lifted and the Council of Foreign Ministers had once more been called into session. That record showed that the United Nations had generated persistent and powerful influences for the peaceful settlement of the most dangerous dispute that had arisen since the end of the war. Those influences for peace had persisted in spite of all the setbacks and had eventually prevailed. The Secretary-General mentioned other circumstances in which the United Nations had also proved its value as a peacemaker, although it had not had a single soldier to enforce its decisions. In the case of Palestine, as in that of Berlin, there had been many setbacks, but no temporary defeat had been able to prevent the United Nations influence for peace from re-asserting itself. As recently as the preceding week that influence had given another demonstration of its power to re-assert itself in Indonesia. The United Nations had perhaps been thought of too much as an enforcement agency. In the Secretary-General's opinion, the chief role of the United Nations in the prevention of war was to act as a peacemaker among the Governments, using persuasion instead of guns and giving voice to the moral jlldgment and will for peace of all the peoples of the world. The United Nations was gradually becoming more like a parliament of the world, to which all the most difficult problems of humanity were sooner or later brought for consideration, judgment and action. In that connexion, the SecretaryGeneral wished to say that the Press, radio and television had done important work during the third session towards making that role of the United Nations more widely understood. The efforts to bridge differences and to keep conflicts of ieleology within peaceful bounds should never be allowed to stop because of temporary failures. He hoped that the great Powers would not again permit the Council of Foreign Ministers to stop work, no matter how wide the gulf between the parties might seem to be. There was no difference, anywhere in the world, so wide that it could not in time be bridged. In the four months which would elapse before the following session of the Assembly, there would be many difficult tasks to face. The problems of Palestine, Indonesia, Kashmir, the Balkans, Korea and the question of the former Italian colonies would require the full co-operation of all the Member Governments. The armistice agreements in Palestine should be followed by permanent peace between Israel and the neighbouring Arab States. There was most urgent need for more support by Governments of the programme of United Nations Relief for Palestine Refugees. There were almost twice as many people in need of relief as had been thought during the first part of the third session and, so far, only half as much money and food as had been considered necessary, It would thus be essential to continue the programme after 31 August 1949. The Secretary-General urged all Governments to give the matter further consideration and to respond to the appeals. The successful completion of the programme would have to be followed by a long-range programme of economic development for the whole area as the framework for the repatriatiol1 and resettlement of the refugees. The problem of Germany was again in the hands of the Council of Foreign Ministers, as the framers of the Charter had intended it to be. No miracles should be expected from the coming meeting, but he hoped that the great Powers would contll1ue to follow the United Nations way of conciliation and persuasion throughout the difficult negotiations.

The United Nations would never be able to make peace secure until the great Powers reached a settlcment of the Second World War. In the meantime, it would continue to exert a greater influence for peace than any other force at work in thc world, by embracing within it both East and \Vest, by acting as mediator and conciliator in conflicts of all kinds and by organizing on an immense scale a world-wide movement to reduce economic, social and politica~ injustice and to extend buman rights. In conclusion, the Secretary-General said that the United Nations was working against the recurrence of war in the near or distant future. The events of the past six months had proved that the United Nations way was the road to peace. I\1r. AUSTIN (United States of America) thanked the President for the way in which he had guided the Assembly through its third session. The office of President of the General Assembly was perhaps the foremost position of responsibility in the field of wotld statesmanship and Mr. Evatt had discharged that responsibility ably and well. His faith in the United Nations had been a strong force and ,had constantly reminded representatives of their obligations to the people of the world. Mr. Austin further thanked the SecretaryGeneral, the Executive Assistant to the SecretaryGeneral and all the members of the Secretariat for their contribution to the Assembly's work. Tbe session had been a difficult one and there had sometimes been sharp disagreements among the representatives, but it was, after all, the purpose of the Organization to bring the representatives of various countries together so that they could work out their differences. The United Nations had even tackled the problems of peace settlements and, although it had not yet reached constructive solutions, it had brought the conflicting views of fifty-nine independent nations to bear on that task. Mr. Austin thought the Assembly could justifiably be proud of the accomplishments of its third session. In his opinion, resolution 267 (Ill) on the problem of voting in the Security Council came high 011 the list of achievements. The recommendation for the use of restraint and self-discipline as a step towards the gradual liberalization of the voting procedure in the Security Council, would, he felt, contribute greatly to the more effective functioning of the United Nations.

Great progress had also been made in the field of human rights. Thus the Assembly had adopted resolution 217 (Ill) proclaiming the Universal Declaration of Human Rights; resolution 260 (Ill) approving the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide; and resolution 277 (Ill) C approving the Convention on the International Transmission of News and the Right of Correction. The third session of the General Assembly might well be known in history as the human rights session. In conclusion, Mr. Austin said that the service of the United Nations to the cause of peace would continue to grow in scope and effectiveness as long as representatives could rise from such deliberations as had taken place during the third session and say that, despite their differences, the countries they represented still formed the United Nations.

Mr. ARcE (Argentina) said that in spite of, or perhaps because of, the happenings of the previous twenty-four hours, the Argentine delegation main~ tained its optimism. It was unfortunate that, when the United Nations had been given the opportunity of solving such an important question for world peace as that of the disposal of the former Italian colonies, it had been unable to reach a concrete solution on the subject. It was unfortunate from the point of view of the inhabitants of the former Italian colonies and because it would involve delay before the Italian people could show that they belonged to a new democratic Italy which was prepared to walk side by side with the other free and independent countries of the world. Nevertheless, the Argentine delegation maintained its optimism. Mr. Arce referred to the recent important announcement that the Council of Foreign 1I1Iinisters was to resume its discussions, following on the lifting of the Berlin blockade. That was an event \~hich should not pass unnoticed in the Assembly, SlUce the Assembly itself, on the initiative of the reoresentative of Mexico. had unanimously adooted a resolution calling upon the great Powers to compose their differences and to work together for peace. The activity of the so-called neutrals in the Security Council, under the leadership of the representative of Argentina, should also be borne in mind. The efforts of those delegations had failed at that time but the attempt had been valuable and had been appreciated by all. On that occasion, the Argentine delegation had worked with the same end in view that it had always had since becoming a Member of the United Nations. It had worked for the co-ordination of all political interests, for conciliation between great and small Powers and for the peaceful outlook which would eventually bring about social a~? l?olitical harmony. The spiri! of peaceful conclhatlOn pursued by the Argentme delegation as well as the unanimous adoption of the resolution introduced by Mexico had both contributed greatly towards influencing the attitude adopted by the great Powers. The representative of Argentina thaI1ked the ~ecretary-General for his expression of appreciabon of the efforts made by the head of the Argentine delegation in Paris. He also thanked the President of the Assembly for the way in whic? he had g?ided it through its work. The Argentl11e delegatlOn had sometimes had differences of opinion with the Australian delegation. Nevertheless, Mr. Arce emphasized that the two countries were very friendly towards one another. As Mr. Austin had said, it was by bringing difficulties into the open and discussing them that agreement would eventually be reached. It was not possible to solve everything easily but all delegations should approach problems with goodwill, a real love for peace and a continuous desire to help the United Nations towards success. The delegation of Argentina had always been inspired by the desire to work for the unity of peoples and their social progress and especially for peace and security in the world.

The PRESIDENT endorsed all that had already been said in appreciation of the work of the Secretary-General, the Executive Assistant to the Secretary-General and the members of the Secretariat. He also appreciated the work of those who had kept the public informed of the Assembly's progress. To keep the public informed was a basic principle of the United Nations. As had been said by the previous speakers, much had happened since the opening of the third session of the Assembly in September 1948. One thing had become supremely evident in that period, namely, that the United Nations was a going concern and that it had come to stay. As he had stated at the end of the first part of the third session, almost every world problem had been placed in one form or another before the Assembly, and he believed, as he had then, that the United Nations had once again proved itself to be the most powerful influence for peace in the world. 

At the opening of the second part of the third session he had stated that there was no substitute for the United Nations, that it was really the only world instrument for peace with justice and that any arrangements by Member nations, valuable though they might be, were necessarily ancillary and subordinate to the United Nations itself. The third session had demonstrated the truth of that statement. 

Reviewing the progress made since the San Francisco Conference, the President said that the Assembly was emerging strongly as a parliament of the peace-loving nations of the world. It was indeed a mirror of the world, as had been th~ objective of those who had worked at San FranCISCO.

The United Nations was not only an active and dynamic people's Organization,. it :was a growi,ng representative body. At the begll1111ng of the thIrd session there had been fifty-eight Members. There were now fifty-nine, and he felt sure that the fifty_- ninth Member State would prove a stalwart and loyal Member of the United Nations. He sincerely hoped that there would soon be many more than fifty-nine Members and that the Organization would gradually become universal, in accordance with the principle enunciated in resolution 197 (Ill) B of the General Assembly, to which the Assembly drew the attention of the Security Council.

The Secretary-General had mentioned the great event of the lifting of the Berlin blockade and the re-convening of the Council of Foreign l\linisters. The United Nations organs and representatives had worked hard on the Berlin question and their efforts had helped to prepare the way for the eventual success of the negotiations. The representative of Argentina had quite rightly referred to the importance of the resolution submitted by Mexico and unanimously adopted during the first part of the third session. That resolution remained as a continued call to the great Powers to bring about a final settlement of the war and the conclusion of all the peace treaties, not only in Europe but in the equally and vitally important region of the Far East. The resolution also called upon them to associate with them the nations which had helped to win the war against the aggressors.

The Berlin negotiations had proved that, in order to have peace, it was necessary to be persistent, patient and persevering and never to give up hope or to despair. The session that was just drawing to its close had been an important event in the history of the world. As he had ventured to predict earlier, the voices of the cynics and the mischief makers had become subdued, because it had become even more apparent to the people of the world that the United Nations was really their best hope on earth for peace. Therefore, when considering the achievements of the third session, representatives should not be too much concerned because the question of the disposal of the formel- Italian colonies had not been solved. The great Powers had, after all, considered the problem for three years and had failed to solve it, while the General Assembly had been dealing with it for only a few months and would possibly solve it during the following session.

In leaving the office of President of the Assembly. he wished to give a few parting words of advice. It was in the best interests of the United Nations for all Members to express their views on all questions and to search for the just solution and not merely for the one which seemed expedient. If all delegations would follow that course, the cause of peace would be served and the prestige of the General Assembly would continue to grow. 

Finally, he expressed the hope that the dele~ations which had voted in favour of the ConventIon outlawing genocide would do their best to persuade their countries to ratify it as soon as possible. He also urged all Member States to support to their utmost the International Children's Emergency Fund and the United Nations Appeal for Children.

In conclusion, he stated that the peoples of the world could rest assured that the United Nations would continue in its struggle for peace until the victory of peace with justice had been achieved. The session had begun on that note and it was on that note that it would end. He had tried to hold the office of President as a United Nations office and not merely as a representative of his own country. He had tried to look beyond the interests of the country which he happened to represent, because he believed that it was in the interests of his own country and of every other country and of all the people of the world to make the United Nations a success. Thanking the representatives for their co-operation, generosity and patience, the President declared the third session of the General Assembly closed. The meeting rose at 6.20 p.m.

10028,"Harry S. Truman, Presidential Inauguration Speech",https://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/truman.asp,Harry S. Truman,President (United States),Inauguration Speech,1949,,"Mr. Vice President, Mr. Chief Justice, and fellow citizens, I accept with humility the honor which the American people have conferred upon me. I accept it with a deep resolve to do all that I can for the welfare of this Nation and for the peace of the world.

In performing the duties of my office, I need the help and prayers of every one of you. I ask for your encouragement and your support. The tasks we face are difficult, and we can accomplish them only if we work together.

Each period of our national history has had its special challenges. Those that confront us now are as momentous as any in the past. Today marks the beginning not only of a new administration, but of a period that will be eventful, perhaps decisive, for us and for the world.

It may be our lot to experience, and in large measure to bring about, a major turning point in the long history of the human race. The first half of this century has been marked by unprecedented and brutal attacks on the rights of man, and by the two most frightful wars in history. The supreme need of our time is for men to learn to live together in peace and harmony.

The peoples of the earth face the future with grave uncertainty, composed almost equally of great hopes and great fears. In this time of doubt, they look to the United States as never before for good will, strength, and wise leadership.

It is fitting, therefore, that we take this occasion to proclaim to the world the essential principles of the faith by which we live, and to declare our aims to all peoples.

The American people stand firm in the faith which has inspired this Nation from the beginning. We believe that all men have a right to equal justice under law and equal opportunity to share in the common good. We believe that all men have the right to freedom of thought and expression. We believe that all men are created equal because they are created in the image of God.

From this faith we will not be moved.

The American people desire, and are determined to work for, a world in which all nations and all peoples are free to govern themselves as they see fit, and to achieve a decent and satisfying life. Above all else, our people desire, and are determined to work for, peace on earth--a just and lasting peace--based on genuine agreement freely arrived at by equals.

In the pursuit of these aims, the United States and other like- minded nations find themselves directly opposed by a regime with contrary aims and a totally different concept of life.

That regime adheres to a false philosophy which purports to offer freedom, security, and greater opportunity to mankind. Misled by this philosophy, many peoples have sacrificed their liberties only to learn to their sorrow that deceit and mockery, poverty and tyranny, are their reward.

That false philosophy is communism.

Communism is based on the belief that man is so weak and inadequate that he is unable to govern himself, and therefore requires the rule of strong masters.

Democracy is based on the conviction that man has the moral and intellectual capacity, as well as the inalienable right, to govern himself with reason and justice.

Communism subjects the individual to arrest without lawful cause, punishment without trial, and forced labor as the chattel of the state. It decrees what information he shall receive, what art he shall produce, what leaders he shall follow, and what thoughts he shall think.

Democracy maintains that government is established for the benefit of the individual, and is charged with the responsibility of protecting the rights of the individual and his freedom in the exercise of his abilities.

Communism maintains that social wrongs can be corrected only by violence.

Democracy has proved that social justice can be achieved through peaceful change.

Communism holds that the world is so deeply divided into opposing classes that war is inevitable.

Democracy holds that free nations can settle differences justly and maintain lasting peace.

These differences between communism and democracy do not concern the United States alone. People everywhere are coming to realize that what is involved is material well-being, human dignity, and the right to believe in and worship God.

I state these differences, not to draw issues of belief as such, but because the actions resulting from the Communist philosophy are a threat to the efforts of free nations to bring about world recovery and lasting peace.

Since the end of hostilities, the United States has invested its substance and its energy in a great constructive effort to restore peace, stability, and freedom to the world.

We have sought no territory and we have imposed our will on none. We have asked for no privileges we would not extend to others.

We have constantly and vigorously supported the United Nations and related agencies as a means of applying democratic principles to international relations. We have consistently advocated and relied upon peaceful settlement of disputes among nations.

We have made every effort to secure agreement on effective international control of our most powerful weapon, and we have worked steadily for the limitation and control of all armaments.

We have encouraged, by precept and example, the expansion of world trade on a sound and fair basis.

Almost a year ago, in company with 16 free nations of Europe, we launched the greatest cooperative economic program in history. The purpose of that unprecedented effort is to invigorate and strengthen democracy in Europe, so that the free people of that continent can resume their rightful place in the forefront of civilization and can contribute once more to the security and welfare of the world.

Our efforts have brought new hope to all mankind. We have beaten back despair and defeatism. We have saved a number of countries from losing their liberty. Hundreds of millions of people all over the world now agree with us, that we need not have war--that we can have peace.

The initiative is ours.

We are moving on with other nations to build an even stronger structure of international order and justice. We shall have as our partners countries which, no longer solely concerned with the problem of national survival, are now working to improve the standards of living of all their people. We are ready to undertake new projects to strengthen the free world.

In the coming years, our program for peace and freedom will emphasize four major courses of action.

First, we will continue to give unfaltering support to the United Nations and related agencies, and we will continue to search for ways to strengthen their authority and increase their effectiveness. We believe that the United Nations will be strengthened by the new nations which are being formed in lands now advancing toward self-government under democratic principles.

Second, we will continue our programs for world economic recovery.

This means, first of all, that we must keep our full weight behind the European recovery program. We are confident of the success of this major venture in world recovery. We believe that our partners in this effort will achieve the status of self-supporting nations once again.

In addition, we must carry out our plans for reducing the barriers to world trade and increasing its volume. Economic recovery and peace itself depend on increased world trade.

Third, we will strengthen freedom-loving nations against the dangers of aggression.

We are now working out with a number of countries a joint agreement designed to strengthen the security of the North Atlantic area. Such an agreement would take the form of a collective defense arrangement within the terms of the United Nations Charter.

We have already established such a defense pact for the Western Hemisphere by the treaty of Rio de Janeiro.

The primary purpose of these agreements is to provide unmistakable proof of the joint determination of the free countries to resist armed attack from any quarter. Each country participating in these arrangements must contribute all it can to the common defense.

If we can make it sufficiently clear, in advance, that any armed attack affecting our national security would be met with overwhelming force, the armed attack might never occur.

I hope soon to send to the Senate a treaty respecting the North Atlantic security plan.

In addition, we will provide military advice and equipment to free nations which will cooperate with us in the maintenance of peace and security.

Fourth, we must embark on a bold new program for making the benefits of our scientific advances and industrial progress available for the improvement and growth of underdeveloped areas.

More than half the people of the world are living in conditions approaching misery. Their food is inadequate. They are victims of disease. Their economic life is primitive and stagnant. Their poverty is a handicap and a threat both to them and to more prosperous areas.

For the first time in history, humanity possesses the knowledge and the skill to relieve the suffering of these people.

The United States is pre-eminent among nations in the development of industrial and scientific techniques. The material resources which we can afford to use for the assistance of other peoples are limited. But our imponderable resources in technical knowledge are constantly growing and are inexhaustible.

I believe that we should make available to peace-loving peoples the benefits of our store of technical knowledge in order to help them realize their aspirations for a better life. And, in cooperation with other nations, we should foster capital investment in areas needing development.

Our aim should be to help the free peoples of the world, through their own efforts, to produce more food, more clothing, more materials for housing, and more mechanical power to lighten their burdens.

We invite other countries to pool their technological resources in this undertaking. Their contributions will be warmly welcomed. This should be a cooperative enterprise in which all nations work together through the United Nations and its specialized agencies wherever practicable. It must be a worldwide effort for the achievement of peace, plenty, and freedom.

With the cooperation of business, private capital, agriculture, and labor in this country, this program can greatly increase the industrial activity in other nations and can raise substantially their standards of living.

Such new economic developments must be devised and controlled to benefit the peoples of the areas in which they are established. Guarantees to the investor must be balanced by guarantees in the interest of the people whose resources and whose labor go into these developments.

The old imperialism--exploitation for foreign profit--has no place in our plans. What we envisage is a program of development based on the concepts of democratic fair-dealing.

All countries, including our own, will greatly benefit from a constructive program for the better use of the world's human and natural resources. Experience shows that our commerce with other countries expands as they progress industrially and economically.

Greater production is the key to prosperity and peace. And the key to greater production is a wider and more vigorous application of modern scientific and technical knowledge.

Only by helping the least fortunate of its members to help themselves can the human family achieve the decent, satisfying life that is the right of all people.

Democracy alone can supply the vitalizing force to stir the peoples of the world into triumphant action, not only against their human oppressors, but also against their ancient enemies-- hunger, misery, and despair.

On the basis of these four major courses of action we hope to help create the conditions that will lead eventually to personal freedom and happiness for all mankind.

If we are to be successful in carrying out these policies, it is clear that we must have continued prosperity in this country and we must keep ourselves strong.

Slowly but surely we are weaving a world fabric of international security and growing prosperity.

We are aided by all who wish to live in freedom from fear--even by those who live today in fear under their own governments.

We are aided by all who want relief from the lies of propaganda-- who desire truth and sincerity.

We are aided by all who desire self-government and a voice in deciding their own affairs.

We are aided by all who long for economic security--for the security and abundance that men in free societies can enjoy.

We are aided by all who desire freedom of speech, freedom of religion, and freedom to live their own lives for useful ends.

Our allies are the millions who hunger and thirst after righteousness.

In due time, as our stability becomes manifest, as more and more nations come to know the benefits of democracy and to participate in growing abundance, I believe that those countries which now oppose us will abandon their delusions and join with the free nations of the world in a just settlement of international differences.

Events have brought our American democracy to new influence and new responsibilities. They will test our courage, our devotion to duty, and our concept of liberty.

But I say to all men, what we have achieved in liberty, we will surpass in greater liberty.

Steadfast in our faith in the Almighty, we will advance toward a world where man's freedom is secure.

To that end we will devote our strength, our resources, and our firmness of resolve. With God's help, the future of mankind will be assured in a world of justice, harmony, and peace."
10029,"Konrad Adenauer, Chancellor Inauguration Speech",https://germanhistorydocs.ghi-dc.org/pdf/eng/Founding%207%20ENG.pdf,Konrad Adenauer,Chancellor (Germany),Inauguration Speech,1949,,"I have the honor to pay you a visit in company with some of the members of my Cabinet, thereby establishing the first contact between the Government of the Federal Republic of Germany and the three High Commissioners. Now that the German Federal Assembly has convened, and the Federal president been elected, and now that I have been chosen Federal Chancellor and the members of the Federal Cabinet have been appointed, a new chapter of German history of the postwar years begins.—The disaster of the second world war has left in its wake a Germany almost totally destroyed. Our cities were in ruins. Economic life was largely smashed. All vestiges of a government had ceased. The very souls of men had suffered such injuries that it seemed doubtful whether a recovery would ever be possible. During the four years following the disaster of 1945, legislative and executive power was largely vested in the occupation powers. It was only step by step that executive and legislative functions were redelegated to German authorities on various levels, and with a limited power to make decisions. It is fitting and proper to acknowledge gratefully that the German population was saved during these trying years from starvation by Allied help in supplying food which at the time could not be purchased with the proceeds of German exports. It was this help which made possible the start of reconstruction. Now that the governmental and legislative elements of the German Federal Republic are being built up, a large part of the responsibility and the authority to make decisions will pass into German hands. We do not, of course, possess as yet complete freedom; since there are considerable restrictions contained in the occupation statute. We will do our part to bring about an atmosphere in which the Allied powers will see their way clear to apply the occupation statute in a liberal and generous manner; only in this way will the German people be able to attain full freedom. We hope that the Allied powers will, by making a corresponding use of the revision clause in the occupation statute, hasten the further political development of our country. It is the unshakable wish of the new Federal Government first and foremost to tackle the great social problems. The Government is convinced that a sound political entity can only develop when each individual is assured a maximum of economic opportunity to earn a livelihood. Not until we succeed in converting the flotsam millions of refugees into settled inhabitants by providing them with housing and adequate opportunities for work will we be able to enjoy inner stability in Germany. Disorder and crises in this part of Europe, however, constitute a serious threat to the security of the entire continent. For this reason, the social program of the Federal Government should at the same time act to ensure a peaceful development in Europe. We will, of course, do everything in our power to master these problems with the forces at our command. Nevertheless, I feel I am justified in believing even now that the problem of expellees is not only a national, but an international one. To solve it, the help of the rest of the world is needed. The Federal Government would, therefore, welcome it greatly if the members of the High Commission would urge their governments to devote in future more attention to this problem. If we want to establish peace in Europe, we can in the view of the Federal Government achieve this only by working along entirely new methods. We see opportunities to do so in the efforts for a European federation which has just borne its first fruits [at] Strasbourg. We do believe, however, that such a federation will only have vitality if built on close economic cooperation among the nations. The organization created by the Marshall Plan represents a good start in this direction. Germany is fully ready to cooperate responsibly in this regard. We see another opening for creating a positive and viable European federation in the hope that the control of the Ruhr region would cease to be a unilateral arrangement and that it would gradually grow into an organism which would embrace the basic industries of other European countries as well. We are certain that the narrow nationalistic conception of the states as it prevailed in the 19th and early 20th centuries may now be said to be overcome. This conception gave birth to nationalism, with its attendant splintering of life in Europe. If we now turn back to the sources of our European civilization, born of Christianity, then we cannot fail to succeed in restoring the unity of European life in all fields of endeavor. This is the sole effective assurance for maintaining peace. "

R6MULo, PRESIDENT OF THE FOURTH SESSION . 2. The TEMPORARY PRESIDENT: Fellow rep- ,resentatives, I welcome you to this fifth session of the General Assembly. 3. Custom has decreed that the outgoing President of the General Assembly should present an extended report on the world situation as a background for the tasks of the current seBsion. I· shall break with that custom, for no words of mine can possibly add to the terrible, eloquence of recent events. Heretofore, despite many fears, we have come together hopef'ully to build for peace. Today we are gathered at a desperate hour to save the peace of the world. 4. Men will hang upon the words we speak here. Yet experience will have taught them that mere words are . a cruel mockery while men are dying for the sake of, peace and the United Nations. They have, a right to expect more, much more than words. Not by what we say but by what we do here shall their anxiety be allayed and their faith restored. 5. The present session is the political equivalent of the military action which the United Nations forces are carrying out in Korea. The victory of those forces will eliminate the gravest challenge yet hurled against the authority of the United Nations. In anticipation of This Assembly, often described in the past as a mere international debating society, has the chance to grow into a virtual parliament of man. It has the chance to save the United Nations and the peace of the world. Let us pray to almighty God to grant us the vision and the courage to discharge this awesome responsibility. Minute of silent meditation 7. The TEMPORARY PRESIDENT: I invite the representatives to rise and observe one minute of silence dedicated to prayer or meditation. The representatives stood in silence. Question of the representation of China in the . United Nations 8. Sir Benegal N. RAU (India): My delegation has given notice of a draft resolution, copies of which have, I believe, already been circulated to all Members of the United Nations. The draft resolution [A/1365] reads as follows: ((The General Assembly, ((Noting that the, Republic of China is a Member of the United Nations and of various organs thereof, ((Considering that the obligations of a Member under the Charter of the United Nations cannot be carried out except by a government which, with a reasonable expectancy of permanence, actually exercises control over the territory of that Member and commands the obedience of its people, ((Recognizing that the Central Government of the People's Republic of China is the only such government functioning in the Republic of China as now constituted, ((Decides that the aforesaid Central Government through its Head, or its Minister for Foreign Affairs, or its accredited representatives, as the case may. be, shall be entitled to represent the Republic of China in the General Assembly and ((Recommends that the other organs of the United Nations adopt similar resolutions."" 9. I am well aware that it is unusual, not to say unprecedented, for the General Assembly to deal with a resolution at so early a stage, but the circumstances are also unpreCed(~ll1ted. 10. I understand that two sets of credentials have been received from two different authorities in respect of the Republic of China. As you all know, we have to appoint at the be!~inning of each session a Credentials Committee to examine the credentials of the representa- .tives and to report without delay. I emphasize the words ""without delay"" as showing that questions relating to credentials are regarded as urgent matters. The two sets of credentials which I have just mentioned will thus go before the Credentials Committee, which will have to report to the General Assembly the result ot its examination, but the question involved in this particular case is of unusual and perhaps unprecedented' difficulty. 11. Which of the two governments claiming to represent the Republic of China is the government entitled to issue credentials? This is a question which has been engaging the attention of various organs of the United Nations for the last eight or nine months without receiving a final answer, and it is not to be. expected that the Credentials Committee would be able to answer it. In all probability the Credentials Committee would report that this important and difficult question had arisen and then leave it to the General Assembly to decide under rule 29 of our rules of procedure. 12. Here, then, is a question which, unless we deal with it at once, will in all probability come before us in the. very near future in conllexion with the report of the Credentials Committee. I venture to suggest that the General Assembly should deal with the matter at once, or at least when the report of the Credentials Committee is before us, but not later because, as I have said, the question is one relating to credentialsthat is to say, whether the credentials emanate from the proper source, from the right government - and should), therefore, be disposed of without delay. In the view of my delegation it should be dealt with as early as possible and a decision arrived at while the atmosphere of the General Assembly is calm and the temperature not too high. Experience has shown that the temperature is apt to rise with the progress of the se.ssion, and then a decision on the merits becomes very difficult. I leave it to th~ President to decide, either as a point of order or, if he prefers, after taking the sense of the ! General Assembly, whether the draft resolution is to be discussed and voted upon at once, that is to say, in a:dvance of the report of the Credentials Committee, or whether it is to be disposed of in connexion with that report. I shall speak on the merits of the draft resolution in due course after this preliminary point has been settled. . 13. The TEMPORARY PRESIDENT: The representative of India has raised a question which bears a certain relationship to the organizational steps which the General Assembly takes during the early part of its session. Although it appears to the Chair proper that such a question should be raised at this time, the introduction of a draft resolution of this character at the first meeting of a session raises a procedural problem which is not specifically covered in the rules of procedure. Indeed, the situation which has given rise to the presentation of the Indian draft resolution is one on which the rules of procedure give no specific guidance. I believe, therefore, that it would be inappropriate for the President to make any ruling upon the application to be given to the rules of procedure in the present circumstances. 14. I wish to point out, however, that the General Assembly is the master of its own procedure, and I therefore invite the Assembly to consider what procedure it wishes to adopt with regard to the proposal which has just been made by the representative of India"

23. The TEMPORARY PRESIDENT (translated from Frmch): In my capacity as acting President I have the privilege of inaugurating the work of the sixth session of the General Assembly of the United Nations. 24. It was only yesterday that the fifth session was declared closed, after more than a year of multifarious activities and a sometimes agitated existence. 25. In the political field, Korea and, more generally, the Far East held the Assembly's attention most constantly and for the longest time. On that subject the Assembly adopted several important decisions, dealing with the unification and rehabilitation of Korea, the cessation of hostilities and the intervention of the People's Republic of China. Moreover, the events in Korea induced the Assembly to adopt a se:ies of measures aimed at reinforcing the system of collective security by an appropriate use of the Assembly's competen(.~ eu""ld powers. 26. I should like to draw your attention to the true nature and profound meaning of the various resolutions the Assembly adopted on thest· subjects. Although these resolutions have a single aim. the establishment and maintenance of peace, they show v;;o tendencies and two complementary purposes. It was ·fi.c Assembly's wish to affirm the determination of the United Nations to check any aggression from whatever S01lrc~, and at the same time to provide the Member nations with the means of effectively opposing aggression. It is clear, however, that collective security and its reinforcement, Q conceived by theA.ssembly, should be thought of and applied as a means of preven·.ting war. 27. The Assembly al!3o made many attempts to bring about th~ cessation of hostilities and a peaceful·settlement of the conflict. To refresh your memories, I would recall the constitution of the committee' of three [resolution 384 (V)], the declaration of principle and the programme of action which were adopted by the Assembly, and lastly the establishment of the Good Offices Committee rrtloluticm 498 (V)]. I would also recall the resolution [3t1 (Y)] in which the Assembly recommended that the United States, France, the United Kingdom and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics should meet to resume the consideration of outstanding problems, resolve fundamental differences and reach agreement in accordance with the seirit of the Charter. I would also recall the resolution [494 (V)] adopted by the General Assembly regarding the submission for study by the appropriate orgms of the United Nations of the various points in the Secretary-General's memorandum on the development of a twenty-year prorramme for achieving peace through the United Nations. 28. Thus, it seems to me, resistance to aggressiol7 and the peaceful settlement of disputes have been the hTo facets of the work of the fifth session. In pursuing tW..t work, the Assembly has shown itself faithful to Chapter I of the Charter, which, in connexion with the maintenance of international peace and security, urges the necessity both of taking ""effective collective measures... lor the suppression of acts of aggression"" and of bringing about "" by peaceful means... adjustment or settlement of... disputes or situations which might lead to a breach of the peace "". 29. Furthermore, we are well aware that, if peace is to be established and maintained, it is not enough to resist aggression or bring about the leaceful settlement of disputes. Action at once bold an patient must be taken to develop international co-operation so as to ensure economic and social progress, and more particularly. to raise the standard of living of the peoples. Here again, the Assembly has done useful work by furthering tile application of the expanc ed programme of technical assistance. In this field, as in nany others, much remains to be done, but the direction h:'s been shown and the way prepared. 30. It is not for me to trace the programme of your future work, and still less to prejudge its conclusion. I shall, however, ask your permission to make an observation and express a hope. When, on 19 ~eptember1S:l50, the Assembly began the work of its fifth session the situation was grave; international tension was greater than at any other time and fear of a general conflict weighed upon the minds of all. I think I may say that the same IS no longer true t~. The difficulties are of course still great and the co .cts of interests and the cla&a of ideologies persist. Nevertheless, the chances of a successful conclusion of the armistice negotiations now being conducted in Korea seem to have increased and the time no longer seems far distant when hostilities will come to an end. It seems no exaggeration to say that, if that possibility were to become a reality, the face of Lings and, to a certain extent, the international climate and the general atmosphere would be appreciably changed. , 31. I should consider that I was failing in my duty as Temporary President if I did not display optimism, I mean a reasoned and moderate optimism equally remote from rash hope and unconsidered scepticism. To be an optimist in present circumstances is to display faith in the United Nations, in the validity of its principles and the effectiveness of its methods.
32. Never before, perhaps, has the expectation of the peoples been keener or in some respects more anxious. No one, of course, expects this Assembly to res""lve the problems which have been accumulating for se'\reral years by sleight of hand or by some magic operation. Most people, however, hope that you will define the elements ofthe problems and make a beginning with their settlement. All know that if use is made of the United Nations, its Charter, ita machinery and its procedures, they can help to find solutions for the most difficult problems. The .Assembly is and remains the meeting place: the centre of discussivn, for the most varied countries and regimes. That is to say, it provides all with the opportunity of cons~tationswhich may lead to the necessary compromises. 33. I am confident that I interpret the desires of all nations when I express the fervent wish that the deliberations of this Assembly may mark a decisive turningpoint towards the improvement of international relations."

The President has told you that it is his wish, as I am sure it is yours, that I should have full liberty to give my true and faithful counsel in those anxious and baffling times. I shall certainly avail myself of this freedom and feel the more right to do so because any private ambitions I may have cherished in my younger days have been satisfied beyong my wildest dreams. Let me, however, make it clear that I have no official mission or status of any kind and that I speak only for myself. I can, therefore allow my mind, with the experience of a life-time, to play over the problems which beset us on the morrow of our absolute victory in arms; and try to make sure that what has been gained with so much sacrifice and suffering shall be preserved for the future glory and safety of mankind.
The United States stands at this time at the pinnacle of world power. It is a solemn moment for the American democracy. With primacy in power is also joined an awe-inspiring accountability to the future. As you look around you, you must feel not only the sense of duty done but also feel anxiety lest you fall below the level of achievement. Opportunity is here now, clear and shining, for both our countries. To reject it or ignore it or fritter it away will bring upon us all the long reproaches of the after-time. It is necessary that constancy of mind, persistency of purpose and the grand simplicity of decision shall guide and rule the conduct of the English-speaking peoples in peace as they did in war. We must and I believe we shall prove ourselves equal to this severe requirement. A shadow has fallen upon the scenes so lately lighted by the Allied Victory. Nobody knows what Soviet Russia and its Communist international organization intends to do in their immediate future, or what are the limits if any to their expensive and prosolytizing tendencies. I have a strong admiration and regard for the valient Russian people and for my wartime comrade, Marshal Stalin. There is sympathy and goodwill in Britain - and I doubt not here also - towards the peoples of all the Russias and a resolve to persevere through many differences and rebuffs in estalishing lasting friendships. We understand the Russian nood to be secure on her Western frontiers from all renewal of German aggression. We welcome her to her rightful place among the loading nations of the world. Above all we welcome constant, frequent and growing contacts between the Russian people and our own people on both sides of the Atlantic. It is my dutyh, however, to place before you certain facts about the present position in Europe. From Stetting in the Baltic to Triesto in the Adriatic, an iron curtain has descended across the continent. Behind that line lie all the capitals of the ancient states of Central and Eastern Europe. Warsaw, Berlin, Prague, Vienna, Budapest, Belgrade, Bucharest and Sofia, all these famous cities and the populations around them life in the Soviet sphere and all are subject in one form or another, not only to Soviet influence but to a very hihg and increasing measure of control from Moscow. From what I have seen of our Russian friends and Allies during the war, I am convinced that there is nothing they admire so much as strength, and there is nothing for which the y have less respect than for military weakness. For that reason, the old doctrine of a balance of power is unsound. We cannot afford, if we can help it, to work on narrow margins, offering temptations to a trial of strength. If the Western Democracies stand together in strict adherence to the principles of the United Nations Charter, their influence for furthering these principles will be immense and no one is likley to molest them. If however they become divided or falter in their duty, and if these all-important years are allowed to slip way, then indeed catastrophe may overwhelm us all."

The TEMPORARY PRESIDENT: On behalf of the General Assembly, I wish to express my gratitude to Mayor Impellitteri for the cordial words of greeting he has extended to us. The valuable collaboration which the authorities of the City of New York have offered to the United Nations to facilitate its work and to enhance its permanent Headquarters is a true expression of the broad International outlook char.. acteristic of this great city, and it deserves our sincere appreciation. The General Assembly rightly should also extend its gratitude to the members of its Headquarters Advisory Committee, whose advice and im.. portant decisions have helped to guide the planning and the consruction of this building; to the Secretary-Gen.. eral, Mr. Trygve Lie, for his untiring and firm support, which has, contributed in such a degree to the completion of this unique undertaking; and to the group of planners, technicians and workmen of all levels who have participated in one form or another in the construction of buildings which are to be called on to serve as the outstanding monument of world peace. . . 45. (Translated from Spanish) : The General Assembly 6£ the United Nations today begins its seventh session on an international scene still dominated by care and anxiety. 
46. “This is the first time that the General Assemibly has met in this magnificent building whick»front*now on will be its own permanent Headduarters, Let us do all in our power to give this event a symbolic meaning, so that the inauguration of our home shall signify our determination to' remain united, whether we agree or disagree, under the rule of a common ideal. 47. Little progress has been achicved during the past year. The indubitable value of /the Qrganization has been proved in the social and econdimic fields. The world will maintain its hope in the United Nations as long as the United Nations, through its principal organs an the specialized agencics, is bl fo. mepntain the solidarity of peoples and nations in the hope of bettering human existence, 48, An organization like ours, which can daily extend its beneficent action to every corer of the globe, is sowiing the seeds of a peace that will inevitably arise one dsy 25 a result of ghe wellbeing and wisdom of an. Thanks to our peoples’ hopes we can meet again today and face our tasks with enthusiasm, confident that, by patient and persevering effort, we shall in the end achieve the Purposes and Principles of the Charter.
49. In the political sphere, the results this year have not. been very heartening. ‘All activites are governed by the fearwof war, and the atmosphere is one In which few dare to tall about agreement and conciliation because they doubt whether their sentiments will be thought sincere. It is thus all the more urgent to assert that our duty—and_this_applies particularly to the small and medium-sized Powers—is one of conciliation, which we must insist on undertaking at once, Tafors 3 & koo tebn.
 

 
50. The United Nations must, if it is to survive, be a centre where the nations may reconcile their differences and efforts in order to attain universal objectives. Otherwise there is a danger lest the States which are now Members of thedOmxiﬂuﬁnn may find ':hemsduv‘u irrevocably separated, or form groups with no other motive but their. own national interests or immediate, necessities.
51. All the great outstanding questions have become either alarmingly more acute or, failing hope of an immediate solution, inextricably complicated. After the longest and most patient negotiations in history, the Korean question is now again being debated by guns, The Disarmament Commission has made no fgrvgr“l. The problems of German unification and the peace treaty with Austria have practically been shelved.
Everyﬂ:inguunﬂohvebmmfut{e.mdw)mcm we look, in this sad scene, we find pessimism and indifference,

Is the breakdown of the collaboration which united the great Powers dm’ha the Second World 1WI:r{in mt]l]mger of hecg:lmﬂag al and irﬁ;— vocable it possible to buil ing solid, now, upon the evils resulting from MM?
53, After seven years that the United Nations has been in existence, we must admit objectively that, far
 
 

from achieving our fundamental goals, we are faced with, & situation in which the prospects of peace are growing ever smaller and the world, full of alarm and fear is every day losing--as has been the case for the past seven years its best opportunities of spiritual and material progress. We cannot face this picture without distress. We cannot help thinking of the final hour of reckoning, when the world will take to task those who have driven it to this situation, which is completely unjustifiable, because nothing but freedom can be worth one hour of the well-being and prosperity of millions of people. 54. Fortunately, however, the United Nations has been able to counteract some of the adverse factors by measures that clearly show its desire to overcorze its initial mistakes and deficiencies. Thus, side by side with the system of collective security laid down in the Charter, there has been developed a subsidiary system that can work under the aut yrity either of the Security Council which still lacks certain prerequisites for coercive action or of the General Assembly, if the Security Council is not able to take a decision. 55. The Collective Measures Committee has this year completed the essential features of its study of methods and procedures which the United Nations could use in case of aggression, provided in the resolution [377 (V)] entitled ""Uniting for peace"". Many Mem ber States think that this system may not prove effec tive enough against aggression by a great Power, which the original system of the Charter did not contemplate. We must not worry too much about this. The value of any system of security depends less on its theoretical perfection than on the psychological factors which determine and maintain the solidarity of States. 
56. Perhaps the greatest strength of the United Na tions resides in the unalterable adherence of the vast majority of its Members to the principles of the Char ter, and in the love that each of them has for its own liberty and independence. We are firmly convinced, therefore, that each of them in the moment of trial would back its convictions and ideals with all the strength it possessed. 57. Others hold different doubts about the directions in which the United Nations is developing in collective Security and other matters. Such doubts are principally of a légal nature, and hinge on the basic question whether the principle of the world organization is not being sacrificed to a policy of balance of power among the great Powers, and whether, consequently, at least in theory, a step has not been taken back towards an idea of security which, as history has repeatedly proved, has been incapable of preventing war. We must in this respect admit that these developments have resulted from events. Faced with the great dangers that menace us, nothing would have excused the United Nations had it chosen to remain inactive instead of preparing itself for an emergency. However, the time has come to give very special attention to all these problems, in order that we may in due course adopt a permanent system of collective security that will place all aspects of coercive action-political decisions as well as the control of military operations- under the guiding principle of the equal responsibility of all Member States. 58. To be consistent with the principles and purposes of the United Nations, such a system should first seek 
really to eliminate war-that was the object of the principle of the unanimity of the great Powers--and only secondly to maintain international peace and security. 59. No system of collective security can be complete if it is limited to methods and procedures to be em ployed in case of aggression. Any complete system of security designed to resolve conflicts rather than punish transgressions must necessarily include machinery for peaceful settlement. The fact that the Collective Meas ures Committee has already prepared the ground for such a system, suggests that a similar group would do well to study methods and procedures by which the United Nations could help Member States to solve their disputes peacefully. 60. Other encouraging progress has been made be tween the sixth session of the General Assembly and the present one. I would draw attention first to the resolutions adopted by the Human Rights Commission on the self-determination of peoples and nations. I know that these resolutions will probably provoke controversy, but I am sure that the debate need not be sterile but will enable us to define in the simplest terms a principle which became a corner-stone of the United Nations merely through being written into the Charter. 61. The fundamental value of this principle cannot be denied. Individual human rights are based on it, and without it they have neither meaning nor reality. The respect which this principle deserves from all will help to bring about the future independence of those peoples and nations who do not yet possess this ines timable boon, and will also be a powerful impulse to wards international friendship and peace. 
62. There may be many conflicting opinions about the drafts prepared by the Human Rights Commission, but we must welcome them in substance as marking a step forward in the study of a highly important prob 16m. 63. I should like to draw attention, with especial satisfaction, to the work done during the fourteenth session of the Economic and Social Council, and in particular to its examination of the economic develop ment of under-developed countries. I do not know whether, in the midst of the worries which beset us so urgently, we realize the extraordinary importance of the functions which the Charter gives to the Economic and Social Council. The Council itself, perhaps aware of the present limitations of its possibilities, has not yet succeeded in fulfilling its mission completely or in carrying out its functions fully and with authority. This situation ought to change radically, because the Economic and Social Council is the best instrument which the United Nations possesses for establishing an organic peace in the world. 64. The economic development of the under-developed countries is the most important problem facing the Economic and Social Council. The problem is so vast that it is of the very essence of the Council's mission. Technical assistance for economic development has expanded during the present year in such a way as to raise great hopes in its effectiveness, particularly in countries with very little or no industrial development and a primitive agriculture. We must understand, however, that technical assistance is only a preliminary step toward economic development and that the receiv ing countries can profit by it only if commensurate national and international finance is forthcoming at each stage. 65. This fact gives special importance to the recent decision of the Economic and Social Council to study the possibility of setting up an international fund to provide long-term loans and subsidies for carrying out non-self-liquidating projects in the under-developed countries. 66. The world's salvation undoubtedly depends on the help that can be given to these countries to improve their agriculture and industry with all speed. The resulting expansion of world economy is bound to benefit all, rich and poor. The creation of economic stability in many countries would at once strengthen international solidarity. The Achilles' heel of the free nations of the world is the poverty, disease and ignor ance in which the majority of theñi live. This is an essential weakness that the possession of a few modern weapons of war can neither help nor hide. 67. The Korean question is now going to come before the General Assembly which, perhaps with unfortunate results, refrained from dealing with it while the talks at Panmunjom still held out some hope of a satis factory conclusion. The development of events has been anxiously watched by the whole world from the mo ment that these talks reached a deadlock over the prisoner-of-war question, which was, at least appa rently, the only unsolved problem. Anxieties and fears have been further accentuated by the resumption of hostilities on a considerable scale during the last few months, and by the suspension sine die of the armistice talks. 
68. It is not easy to judge this question. Not all Member States are fully able to assess it accurately in all its aspects. Nevertheless, one thing appears clear: that if an armistice has in fact been delayed only by the prisoner-of-war problem, some other ways of solving this problem oy of concluding an honourable armistice in some other form should be sought. Having succeeded in preventing the aggressors from achieving their purpose, the United Nations should concentrate on preventing further destruction of life and property. 69. The principle that prisoners of war should not be forcibly repatriated is both reasonable and pro gressive, confirming the just supremacy of human rights over conventional standards and traditional practices in this field. It is inconceivable that this prin ciple should not honour and ennoble those who profess it, or that the two sides should not be able to come to an agreement about it, except for reasons which have nothing to do with the essence of the principle. The principle of no forcible repatriation, together with a formula that would remove all doubts about the use of prisoners of war in activities prejudicial to their countries of origin, should lead to the conclusion of an armistice or should make it clear that there never had been any intention to conclude one. 70. Mexico has presented a plan which would allow non-repatriated prisoner's of war to find work in ter ritories of Member States of the United Nations 
willing to give them temporary asylum. Other coun tries may have or may think of better solutions. In any case, it is an inescapable obligation to make one more attempt to study the problem so that the Korean war may end. 71. I have thought it my duty, in accordance with precedent, to unfold before you the international situa tion that has developed between the last session of the General Assembly and the present one. It was my wish to call your attention to the most important problems facing us today, because I am convinced that the United Nations still has before it a chance to establish the rule of peace. 72. The division of the world into two halves on the one side the traditional democracies and on the other the peoples' democracies—is at the root of all our difficulties. The effects of this split are found everywhere. We find them in each one of our States, and in the United Nations they have constantly ham pered our progress. They have made the work of governments difficult; they have made international agreement impossible, and, what is worse, they have immensely. harmed the ordinary man in body and soul by inflicting upon him untold sacrifices and all the tortures of despair and fear. This state of affairs cannot last many years more. Mankind will not tolerate it. If the United Nations is to escape from that threat of dramatic disruption which is undermining its very foudations, it must search actively for means of putting an end to the situation. 73. We must try to return to the spirit which pre sided over the birth of the United Nations. The Charter was written, not to enshrine the discords of a divided community, but to direct the march of a community united in the highest ideals of progress. 
74. If only the capitalist States and the communist States could convince each other of one thing, that neither of the two plan the destruction of the other, the suspiciort which divides them would be eliminated. This would produce the only really indispensable factor for the union of the two groups in the service of the superior interests of the human race, which are a thousand times more important than any political, economic or social doctrine. 75. There must be a way of achieving this result. There have always been means of attaining an end when the will to attain it exists. If this will does not exist, and if one or both of the two groups places the objectives of its national policy above the Purposes and Principles of the United Nations and feels that it cannot attain those objectives without annihilating or dis integrating the other group, then we must admit that the very concept of world community has failed. The tremendous war which would follow would be the most complete denial of our aims. 76. If, however, the United Nations succeeded in solving this vital problem, we should have fulfilled the pacific mission which we accepted as a sacred duty after the desolation and ruin of the Second World War.

Eisenhower,President (United States),Inauguration Speech,1953,,"My friends, before I begin the expression of those thoughts that I deem appropriate to this moment, would you permit me the privilege of uttering a little private prayer of my own. And I ask that you bow your heads:

Almighty God, as we stand here at this moment my future associates in the executive branch of government join me in beseeching that Thou will make full and complete our dedication to the service of the people in this throng, and their fellow citizens everywhere.

Give us, we pray, the power to discern clearly right from wrong, and allow all our words and actions to be governed thereby, and by the laws of this land. Especially we pray that our concern shall be for all the people regardless of station, race, or calling.

May cooperation be permitted and be the mutual aim of those who, under the concepts of our Constitution, hold to differing political faiths; so that all may work for the good of our beloved country and Thy glory. Amen.

My fellow citizens:

The world and we have passed the midway point of a century of continuing challenge. We sense with all our faculties that forces of good and evil are massed and armed and opposed as rarely before in history.

This fact defines the meaning of this day. We are summoned by this honored and historic ceremony to witness more than the act of one citizen swearing his oath of service, in the presence of God. We are called as a people to give testimony in the sight of the world to our faith that the future shall belong to the free.

Since this century's beginning, a time of tempest has seemed to come upon the continents of the earth. Masses of Asia have awakened to strike off shackles of the past. Great nations of Europe have fought their bloodiest wars. Thrones have toppled and their vast empires have disappeared. New nations have been born.

For our own country, it has been a time of recurring trial. We have grown in power and in responsibility. We have passed through the anxieties of depression and of war to a summit unmatched in man's history. Seeking to secure peace in the world, we have had to fight through the forests of the Argonne, to the shores of Iwo Jima, and to the cold mountains of Korea.

In the swift rush of great events, we find ourselves groping to know the full sense and meaning of these times in which we live. In our quest of understanding, we beseech God's guidance. We summon all our knowledge of the past and we scan all signs of the future. We bring all our wit and all our will to meet the question:

How far have we come in man's long pilgrimage from darkness toward light? Are we nearing the light--a day of freedom and of peace for all mankind? Or are the shadows of another night closing in upon us?

Great as are the preoccupations absorbing us at home, concerned as we are with matters that deeply affect our livelihood today and our vision of the future, each of these domestic problems is dwarfed by, and often even created by, this question that involves all humankind.

This trial comes at a moment when man's power to achieve good or to inflict evil surpasses the brightest hopes and the sharpest fears of all ages. We can turn rivers in their courses, level mountains to the plains. Oceans and land and sky are avenues for our colossal commerce. Disease diminishes and life lengthens.

Yet the promise of this life is imperiled by the very genius that has made it possible. Nations amass wealth. Labor sweats to create--and turns out devices to level not only mountains but also cities. Science seems ready to confer upon us, as its final gift, the power to erase human life from this planet.

At such a time in history, we who are free must proclaim anew our faith. This faith is the abiding creed of our fathers. It is our faith in the deathless dignity of man, governed by eternal moral and natural laws.

This faith defines our full view of life. It establishes, beyond debate, those gifts of the Creator that are man's inalienable rights, and that make all men equal in His sight.

In the light of this equality, we know that the virtues most cherished by free people--love of truth, pride of work, devotion to country--all are treasures equally precious in the lives of the most humble and of the most exalted. The men who mine coal and fire furnaces and balance ledgers and turn lathes and pick cotton and heal the sick and plant corn--all serve as proudly, and as profitably, for America as the statesmen who draft treaties and the legislators who enact laws.

This faith rules our whole way of life. It decrees that we, the people, elect leaders not to rule but to serve. It asserts that we have the right to choice of our own work and to the reward of our own toil. It inspires the initiative that makes our productivity the wonder of the world. And it warns that any man who seeks to deny equality among all his brothers betrays the spirit of the free and invites the mockery of the tyrant.

It is because we, all of us, hold to these principles that the political changes accomplished this day do not imply turbulence, upheaval or disorder. Rather this change expresses a purpose of strengthening our dedication and devotion to the precepts of our founding documents, a conscious renewal of faith in our country and in the watchfulness of a Divine Providence.

The enemies of this faith know no god but force, no devotion but its use. They tutor men in treason. They feed upon the hunger of others. Whatever defies them, they torture, especially the truth.

Here, then, is joined no argument between slightly differing philosophies. This conflict strikes directly at the faith of our fathers and the lives of our sons. No principle or treasure that we hold, from the spiritual knowledge of our free schools and churches to the creative magic of free labor and capital, nothing lies safely beyond the reach of this struggle.

Freedom is pitted against slavery; lightness against the dark.

The faith we hold belongs not to us alone but to the free of all the world. This common bond binds the grower of rice in Burma and the planter of wheat in Iowa, the shepherd in southern Italy and the mountaineer in the Andes. It confers a common dignity upon the French soldier who dies in Indo-China, the British soldier killed in Malaya, the American life given in Korea.

We know, beyond this, that we are linked to all free peoples not merely by a noble idea but by a simple need. No free people can for long cling to any privilege or enjoy any safety in economic solitude. For all our own material might, even we need markets in the world for the surpluses of our farms and our factories. Equally, we need for these same farms and factories vital materials and products of distant lands. This basic law of interdependence, so manifest in the commerce of peace, applies with thousand-fold intensity in the event of war.

So we are persuaded by necessity and by belief that the strength of all free peoples lies in unity; their danger, in discord.

To produce this unity, to meet the challenge of our time, destiny has laid upon our country the responsibility of the free world's leadership.

So it is proper that we assure our friends once again that, in the discharge of this responsibility, we Americans know and we observe the difference between world leadership and imperialism; between firmness and truculence; between a thoughtfully calculated goal and spasmodic reaction to the stimulus of emergencies.

We wish our friends the world over to know this above all: we face the threat--not with dread and confusion--but with confidence and conviction.

We feel this moral strength because we know that we are not helpless prisoners of history. We are free men. We shall remain free, never to be proven guilty of the one capital offense against freedom, a lack of stanch faith.

In pleading our just cause before the bar of history and in pressing our labor for world peace, we shall be guided by certain fixed principles.

These principles are:

(1) Abhorring war as a chosen way to balk the purposes of those who threaten us, we hold it to be the first task of statesmanship to develop the strength that will deter the forces of aggression and promote the conditions of peace. For, as it must be the supreme purpose of all free men, so it must be the dedication of their leaders, to save humanity from preying upon itself.

In the light of this principle, we stand ready to engage with any and all others in joint effort to remove the causes of mutual fear and distrust among nations, so as to make possible drastic reduction of armaments. The sole requisites for undertaking such effort are that--in their purpose--they be aimed logically and honestly toward secure peace for all; and that--in their result-- they provide methods by which every participating nation will prove good faith in carrying out its pledge.

(2) Realizing that common sense and common decency alike dictate the futility of appeasement, we shall never try to placate an aggressor by the false and wicked bargain of trading honor for security. Americans, indeed all free men, remember that in the final choice a soldier's pack is not so heavy a burden as a prisoner's chains.

(3) Knowing that only a United States that is strong and immensely productive can help defend freedom in our world, we view our Nation's strength and security as a trust upon which rests the hope of free men everywhere. It is the firm duty of each of our free citizens and of every free citizen everywhere to place the cause of his country before the comfort, the convenience of himself.

(4) Honoring the identity and the special heritage of each nation in the world, we shall never use our strength to try to impress upon another people our own cherished political and economic institutions.

(5) Assessing realistically the needs and capacities of proven friends of freedom, we shall strive to help them to achieve their own security and well-being. Likewise, we shall count upon them to assume, within the limits of their resources, their full and just burdens in the common defense of freedom.

(6) Recognizing economic health as an indispensable basis of military strength and the free world's peace, we shall strive to foster everywhere, and to practice ourselves, policies that encourage productivity and profitable trade. For the impoverishment of any single people in the world means danger to the well-being of all other peoples.

(7) Appreciating that economic need, military security and political wisdom combine to suggest regional groupings of free peoples, we hope, within the framework of the United Nations, to help strengthen such special bonds the world over. The nature of these ties must vary with the different problems of different areas.

In the Western Hemisphere, we enthusiastically join with all our neighbors in the work of perfecting a community of fraternal trust and common purpose.

In Europe, we ask that enlightened and inspired leaders of the Western nations strive with renewed vigor to make the unity of their peoples a reality. Only as free Europe unitedly marshals its strength can it effectively safeguard, even with our help, its spiritual and cultural heritage.

(8) Conceiving the defense of freedom, like freedom itself, to be one and indivisible, we hold all continents and peoples in equal regard and honor. We reject any insinuation that one race or another, one people or another, is in any sense inferior or expendable.

(9) Respecting the United Nations as the living sign of all people's hope for peace, we shall strive to make it not merely an eloquent symbol but an effective force. And in our quest for an honorable peace, we shall neither compromise, nor tire, nor ever cease.

By these rules of conduct, we hope to be known to all peoples.

By their observance, an earth of peace may become not a vision but a fact.

This hope--this supreme aspiration--must rule the way we live.

We must be ready to dare all for our country. For history does not long entrust the care of freedom to the weak or the timid. We must acquire proficiency in defense and display stamina in purpose.

We must be willing, individually and as a Nation, to accept whatever sacrifices may be required of us. A people that values its privileges above its principles soon loses both.

These basic precepts are not lofty abstractions, far removed from matters of daily living. They are laws of spiritual strength that generate and define our material strength. Patriotism means equipped forces and a prepared citizenry. Moral stamina means more energy and more productivity, on the farm and in the factory. Love of liberty means the guarding of every resource that makes freedom possible--from the sanctity of our families and the wealth of our soil to the genius of our scientists.

And so each citizen plays an indispensable role. The productivity of our heads, our hands, and our hearts is the source of all the strength we can command, for both the enrichment of our lives and the winning of the peace.

No person, no home, no community can be beyond the reach of this call. We are summoned to act in wisdom and in conscience, to work with industry, to teach with persuasion, to preach with conviction, to weigh our every deed with care and with compassion. For this truth must be clear before us: whatever America hopes to bring to pass in the world must first come to pass in the heart of America.

The peace we seek, then, is nothing less than the practice and fulfillment of our whole faith among ourselves and in our dealings with others. This signifies more than the stilling of guns, easing the sorrow of war. More than escape from death, it is a way of life. More than a haven for the weary, it is a hope for the brave.

This is the hope that beckons us onward in this century of trial. This is the work that awaits us all, to be done with bravery, with charity, and with prayer to Almighty God."

We welcome him warmly and we wish him well as he undertakes his new and internationally important duties. But we do more: we pledge him our co-operation and our support. As chief administrative officer of the United Nations, with all the. Prestige and authority vested in that o%ce by the Charter, he has great and heavy responsibilities in carrying out the resolutions and d,ecisions of our world Organization, in giving leadership and inspiration to our international civil service, and in assisting delegations and governments to develop ancl strengthen international co-operation for peace, progress and greater human welfare. 
5. Our Secretary-General will not be able to discharge these responsibilities as (he would wish, and as we would wish, unless we back him up in every possible way. 
6. Mr. Hammarskjold has served his country with loyalty and distinction in many responsible posts over many years. He has also given many proofs of his devotion to the cause of better relations among States and peoples in the economic, social and political spheres. The experience, knowledge and ability which he has given to one country he now puts at the disposal of many. I am sure that he will find it somewhat more difficult to serve sixty masters than one, but I hope that he may also find it even more stimulating, more challenging and more satisfying. 7. I know Mr. Hammarskjold well enough to give you the assurance that, like his predecessor to whom we paid such sincere tribute on Tuesday last [423rd meeting], he will do his best in the service of the United Nations, and that his best will be very good.
I think I know my colleagues in the Assembly well enough to give our new SecretarydGeneral the assurance that, in his work in the days ahead, he will have our good wishes, our encburagement and our wholehearted assistance. 8. The SECRETARY-GENERAL: May I first of all t,hank you, Mr. President, for your kind and encouraging words of welcome? In the message by which the President of the Security Council informed me of the decision to recommend me as SecretaryGeneral of the United Nations, he drew attention to “the immense importance of this post, especially at the present time”. With humility I accept an election expressing a confidence in me which I have still to justify-with humility inspired as much by my knowledge of personal limitations as by my awareness of the extraordinary responsibility wh’ich YOU impose on me by your election. 
9. My background is, as you know, the civil service of my country-a civil service strengthened by a lot?g tradition and firmly founded on law. It is in the bodies by which the nations of Europe are trying to shape the future of that part of the world that I have gathered the experience I have of international cooperation. There I have learned the vital importance of loyalty, devotion and integrity in those engaged in the work.
10. I bring to this task a firm will to devote myself, without any reserve, to the work carried out by the United Nations in pursuit of its high aims. I am here to serve you all. In so doing, I shall count on your understanding, on your advice and on your will to give to what I have to say, the attention that it may deserve. I am animated by a desire to meet all problems with an open mind. It is for you to judge how I succeed, and it is for you to correct me if I fail. Ours is a work of reconciliation and realistic construction. This worlc must be based on respect for the laws by which human civilization has been built. Tt likewise requires a strict observance of the rules and principles laid down ix: the Charter of this Organization. My work shall be guided by ,this knowledge. 11. This great Organization grew out of the pain and turmoil of the last war. It welded together in what should be a continued co-operation for world peace all those who had fought against oppression. By all who have sacrificed themselves and by all sacrihcing hemselves in the fight for freedom and peace thug Organization has, in the words of one of the great leaders of democracy, been “consecrated . . . far above our poor power to add or detract”. May I quote also these other words from the Gettysburg Address: “The world will little note, nor long remember, what we say here, but it can never forget what they did . . . It is for us t,he living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they . . . have thus far so nobly advanced, It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us . . .”
12. In concluding, may I remind you of the great memory just celebrated by the Christian world? May 
I do so because of what that memory tells us of the redeeming power of true dedication to peace and goodwill towards men? We are of different creeds and convictions. Events and ideas which to some of us remain the very basis of our faith are elements of the spiritual heritage of man which are foreign to others. But common to us all, and above all other convictions, stands the truth once expressed by a Swedish poet when he said that the greatest prayer of man does not ask for victory but for peace.
13. I: have not gone into any of the specific problems facing this Organization, some of them now harassing all minds, but I have tried to indicate the spirit in which I shall go to work when called upon to take part in the efforts of the United Nations to justify the hopes of all its Members.
14. Mr. ABDELRAZEK (Egypt) (trutislateal front Frenclz) : On behalf of the Egyptian delegation I welcome the new Secretary-General of the United Nations, whose prestige and meritorious career are now crowned by this appointment.
15. Since the peoples of the United Nations, in signing the Charter, have resolved “to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war which twice in our lifetime has brought untold sorrow to mankind,” and since, for these ends, they have determined to maintain international peace and security and to promote social and economic progress, we all hope from the bottom of our hearts that the new SecretaryGeneral will be a great symbol of peace and of economic and social development. 
16. We hope that he will be a great symbol of peace, because he is a member of the noble Scandinavian race, which loves peace, believes in it and has shown the world the true meaning of co-operation, both in the national and international spheres and in the politic,al, economic and social felds.
17. We hope that the new Secretary-General is convinced that the political problems raised by the national aspirations of the peoples of Africa and Asia, as also the economic and social problems of the underdeveloped countries, are as great as, and even greater than those caused by the conflict between the major Powers, which I hope will prove merely transitory and temporary.
18. We hope that the new Secretary-General has already formed the opinion that it is impossible to preserve peace either simply by disarmament or simply by an armaments race, but lirst and foremost by the recbgnition of the aspirations to freedom, human dignity and equal rights among nations, and by respect for human rights, as also by sincere co-operation with a view to reviving the hopes of the two-thirds of the world’s population who still live in poverty and wretchedness and who are now resolved to put an end to this state of affairs and to take their rightful place in the international community, basing their stand on the fundamental principles of the United Nations Charter.
19. The road may be long, but the task wil1 not be too arduous if we are constantly guided by an honest spirit of true solidarity, of sacrifice and of respect for rights. This spirit of honesty should be the syni.101 of a free world. It was the lack or’ sucli a spirit that hastened the collapse of the League of Nations. Today it should be t,he foundation of the consolidation of the United Nations.
20. From the depths of my heart I hope that, through very close and very sincere co-operation between all the delegations and the new Secretary-General, the United Nations may always be equal to its task, and nlay become a force truly capable of ensuring peace, frccdotn for the oppressed peoples and prosperity for the poor and hungry. That will be the greatest satisfaction that the new Secretary-General-and, indeed, all of USwill ever experience.
21. Mr, KYROU (Greece) : On behaIf of my GOVernment, I wish Mr, Dag I-Iammarskjold complete SUCcess in his most important assignment. This is much more than a platonic expression, for it implies a pledge on our part to lend him our unreserved support in the discharge of his heavy responsibilities.
22. The circumstances in which the new SecretaryGeneral of the IJnited Nations was recommended by the Security Council for nomination augurs well for the future. Furthermore, the near unanimity with which this recommendation was adopted by the General Assembly three days ago [423rd ntec&g] is a measure of the fund of good-will and co-operation on whidl Mr. Hammarskjold will be able to draw in the years
to come Yesterday, on landing at Idlewild Airport, Mr. Hammarskjold declared that the qualities we all
needed todav were “perseverance and patience, a firm grip on realities, careful but imaginative planning, a clear awareness of the dangers, but also of the fact that fate is what we make it and that the safeslt climber is he who never questions his “ability to overcome all, difficulties”. These can be the words only ,of I man who has his feet firmly planted on the ground and who knows that initiative and inspiration, no matter how creative they may be, cannot bear rich fruit unless they are followed up lay the solid qualities of perseverance and patience. In an imaginative language, stripped of superfluous periphrasis, Mr. Hammarskjold discldsed his belief that nothing should be taken for granted and that peace, like war, must be waged. Fate, he said, is what we make it, for where there is a will there is a way. 
24. Such words, as well as the statement to which we have just listened today, are bound to bring into sharp relief the main moral traits of the man who uttered them. In their light, Mr. Dag Hammarskjofd appears as a true scion of the noble and sturdy Swedish people, who so happily combine an unobtrusive idealism with a clear sense of reality. The United Nations has on many occasions in the past beneiited by these Nordic qualities, with which our out-going SecretaryGeneral, Mr. Trygve Lie, is so abundantly provided. Members of this Organization will keep forever in fond memory the late Count Folke Bernadotte, in whose person these qualities were most heroically incarnated, 2.5. A new chapter in the life of our Organization is about to open. One cannot imagine that any Member State would be unwilling to co-operate in the general interest of peace, even at the sacrifice of some particular and transient interest.
26. On behalf of my Government, I wish Mr. Dag Hammarskjold good luck, or, to say it in his beloved Swedish-and this is a word which is slightly less difficult for a non-Scandinavian to pronounce than Mr. Hammarskjold’s name-ZiicRoacspark, 
27. Mr. VAN LANGEN~HOVI& {B The choice of Mr. Hammarskjold by the Security Council was a happy one, and the General Assembly’s overwhelming support of the recommendation further improves the favourable climate in which our new Secretary-General will begin his work. We all know Mr, Hammarskjold’s excellent qualifications for the post he is now assuming. His personal integrity, his ability in the diplomatc &Id, his familiarity with international and economic problems, his unswerving devotion to the ideals embodied in the United Nations Charter, certainly justify our conviction that we have selected an outstanding man to perform the duties of chief administrative officer of our Organization,
33. I can assure Mlr. I-Iam.marslcjold &at the LatinAmerican delegations will do their utmost to support him, so that the heavy burden which now falls on his shoulders may he lightened.
34, We are fully cognizant of the circumstances which make the task of the Secretary-General of the United Nations, in the present state of world tension, one of the most challenging tests ever entrusted to a human being. Mr. Trygve Lie is a living proof of fhis assertion, but Mr. Lie may rest assured that he will be remembered as a builder of the United Nations and its first organizer. He should have no doubt of the greatness of his achievement. 
35. The general confidence of the Member States and the devoted and intelligent co-operation of the Secretariat, whose ability and whose loyalty to the United Nations have been tested by fire, will certainly enable a man with the outstanding qualifications of Mr. Hammarskjold to meet that test with complete success. It is in this spirit of co-operation and hope that the Latin-American delegations extend their welcome to the new Secretary-General.
36. Sir Gladwyn JEBB (United Kingdom) : My delegation is quite sure that the United Nations could have made no happier choice than that of Mr. Dag Hammarskjold for the post of Secretary-General, left vacant by the resignation of Mr. Trygve Lie, to whom we all owe so much. Those of us here who have the honour of knowing him personally have always, I think, shared my own impression of a strong, cleancut character, of a ‘man of great power, wisdom and understanding and last, but by no means least, of a sympathetic and intelligent human being blessed with that supreme-and, alas, all too rare-gift, a civilized sense of humour.
37. We do not know exactly what Mr. Hammarskjold’s innermost tho,ughts may have been at being suddenly andi as I happen to know, completely unexpectedly pitchforked into this unruly political arena. Perhaps be even thought for a moment of refusing the honour, but if he did, I expect that, as an intelligent man, he reflected on the fate of that mediaeval monk who, unless I am wrong, refused to be Pope and was thereafter condemned by Dante to the lowest category of hell. I suspect indeed that, in some respects at least, his thoughts, when the telephone bell rang Stockholm on that fateful morning, were not unlike those of the prophet Daniel. However, if anybody can tame the lions which occasionally stalk through this building and all too frequently roar from this tribunethe lions, that is, of suspicion, of jealousy, of exclusive nationalism, of race prejudice, of ideology-beasts that, I am afraid, are latent to some extent in all of us-it is precisely the young prophet whom we have now chosen as our guide, counsellor and friend. Nobody can pretend that his task will not be supremely difficult and exacting. Nobody will expect him to please all of us all the time-indeed, unless he occasionally offends somebody, it may be that he will not really be doing his job. But what we can confidently expect is that Mr. Hammarskjold will bend his great intelligence and his admirable character to the task of perfecting a machine which will be for the service of all of US in our joint effort to arrive at lasting peace.
38. I know. that everybody here present will join me in wishing the very best of luck to our new Secretary-General.  time which may be described as the period of dilemmas. He comes at a time when the engines, of destruction and the instruments of killing, on the one hand, are more deadly than the world has ever known before, and, on the other hand, when there is a strong growing feeling and anguish for peace. He also comes at a time when the world has become more fully aware than ever in its history of the terrible economic  equilibrium that exists in the world and is striving very hard and very anxiously, first of all, to study the possible evil effects of that disequilibrium and, secondly, to apply appropriate remedies and solutions. 
77. Mr. Hammarskjold knows very well that the hope of the world in this Organization is growing every day. He also, I am sure,. knows that those who have pinned their hopes perhaps most of all to this Organization are those who are not articulate in its ‘halls today, and that millions of people in the world have not yet found a voice within this Organization, and yet they are the ones who hope this Organization will prove their salvation.
78. I am perfectly sure that he is fully sensible of the tremendous task that lies before this Organization, but, to compensate for all that, may I remind him that the desire of the world for the strengthening, the development, and the betterment of this Organization jvas never greater. Millions of people hope that in the times to come within these walls we shall see peaceful revolutions taking place under the vigilance of the world. They hope that the new formulae of friendship and amity will be evolved as between stronger and weaker peoples.
79. I mention these things, not to depress him or ourselves. Indeed, the choice of the world has fallen upon him because we know he will not be depressed by these problems. The choice of the world has fallen upon him because we know that these problems only quicken his earnestness and zeal in the task. Every illustrious man who comes to occupy an exalted ofice raises expectations in the world, and so does the appointment of Mr. Hammarskjold. Expectations, I assure him, have been raised all over the world, together with the supreme confidence that, at this point in history, the world could hardly have made a better choice for the leadership that the United Nations requires."

Gemäß den Bestimmungen des Vertrages über die Errichtung der Europäischen Gemeinschaft für Kohle und Stahl sind heute die Außenminister und die Wirtschaftsminister der sechs vertragschließenden Länder – Deutschland, Belgien, Frankreich, Italien, Luxemburg und die Niederlande – zusammengetreten, um den im Vertrage vorgesehenen Ministerrat zu konstituieren und ihre Tätigkeit aufzunehmen. Mir ist als dem Vertreter des Landes, das nach der alphabetischen Reihenfolge unserer Staaten voransteht, die Ehre zuteil geworden, der erste Präsident des Ministerrats zu sein. Ich begrüße zunächst die Herren Minister der luxemburgischen Regierung und darf ihnen im Namen des Rates für die Aufnahme danken, die Stadt und Land Luxemburg den Organen der Gemeinschaft bereitet hat. Die Aufnahme solcher Institutionen bringt manche Beschwernisse mit sich. Um so herzlicher danke ich den Luxemburgern, dass sie diese Erschwernisse auf sich genommen haben. Ein ganz besonders herzliches Dankeswort darf ich an unseren Kollegen Bech richten, der uns ja wohl in erster Linie ermöglicht hat, dass wir hier Behausung gefunden haben. Ich begrüße den Präsidenten und die Mitglieder der Hohen Behörde. Ich bin überzeugt, dass die Organe der Gemeinschaft eng zusammenarbeiten werden. Ich begrüße ferner die Mitglieder des bei der großherzoglich-luxemburgischen Regierung beglaubigten diplomatischen Korps und ebenso die Vertreter der großbritannischen Mission und der Mission der Vereinigten Staaten von Nordamerika bei der Hohen Behörde, deren Entsendung und seine enge Verbindung zwischen der Gemeinschaft und diesen beiden Ländern verbürgt. Mit der heutigen Konstituierung des Rates tritt, nachdem die Hohe Behörde bereits vor einem Monat ihre Arbeit aufgenommen hat, nunmehr das zweite Organ der Gemeinschaft in Tätigkeit. Die Aufgabe, die seiner wartet, ist groß und verantwortungsvoll. Er ist das föderative Organ der Gemeinschaft. Als solches hat er nach dem Vertrage eine doppelte Aufgabe. Einerseits wird er als Gemeinschaftsorgan tätig, das heißt als ein Organ des supranationalen Gebildes, das, mit eigenen Hoheitsrechten ausgestattet, nunmehr unabhängig neben den Staaten steht. Als Gemeinschaftsorgan ist der Rat beteiligt an der Ordnung und Verwaltung der Hoheitsrechte, welche die Mitgliedsstaaten aus ihrem Bereich abgesondert und auf die Gemeinschaft übertragen haben. Er ist in dieser Eigenschaft durch den Vertrag zu umfassender Mitwirkung an den von der Gemeinschaft zu treffenden Regelungen berufen. Er wird zu allen wesentlichen Maßnahmen der Hohen Behörde gehört. In wichtigen Fällen ist seine Zustimmung oder Entscheidung notwendig. In besonders bedeutsamen Fragen bedarf es seines einstimmigen Beschlusses. Der Ministerrat hat noch eine zweite Aufgabe. Er vertritt nicht nur die Interessen der Gemeinschaft auf dem Gebiet der übertragenen Hoheitsrechte, sondern er nimmt auch die Interessen der Mitgliedsstaaten selbst auf dem Gebiete der ihnen verbliebenen Hoheitsrechte wahr. Das betrifft sowohl die Fragen der allgemeinen Wirtschaft wie die sonstigen Fragen des staatlichen Lebens, insbesondere die politischen Fragen, die durch die Tätigkeit der Montanunion berührt werden, soweit die Staaten ihre Hoheitsrechte nicht übertragen haben. So hat der Ministerrat eine Verbindungs- und Vermittlerrolle. Er steht im Schnittpunkt zweier Souveränitäten, einer supranationalen und einer nationalen. Er muss den Interessen der Gemeinschaft in gleicher Weise gerecht werden wie den Interessen der einzelnen Staaten und einen Ausgleich finden, der beiden das ihre zuteil werden lässt. Er muss, wie der Vertrag sagt, die beiderseitigen Interessen harmonisieren. Ihm ist damit als Organ eine Aufgabe gestellt, die als Problem vor jedem steht, der um die Einigung Europas bemüht ist. Denn diese Einigung kann nicht darin bestehen, einen europäischen Zentralismus zu schaffen. Sie muss sich, wie der Vertrag über die Verteidigungsgemeinschaft sagt, auf föderativer oder konföderativer Grundlage vollziehen, oder sie wird sich überhaupt nicht vollziehen. Sie muss gleichermaßen der Vielfältigkeit und der Besonderheit der Einzelstaaten, die sich aus der geschichtlichen Vergangenheit ergibt, Rechnung tragen wie der einheitlichen Zusammenfassung, die als Forderung der Zukunft gebieterisch an uns herantritt. Das Werk, das wir unternommen haben, ist ein kühnes Werk. Die Entwicklung der Nationalstaaten seit Beginn des 19. Jahrhunderts hat das Gemeinschaftsgefühl der Staaten nicht gefördert. Wenn auch der Ministerrat die nationalen Interessen der Mitgliedsstaaten zu wahren hat, so wird er sich doch davor zu hüten haben, diese Aufgabe als seine vordringliche zu betrachten. Seine vordringliche Aufgabe wird vielmehr die Förderung der Interessen der Gemeinschaft sein, ohne die diese sich nicht entwickeln kann. Er wird deshalb weiter in großzügiger Weise dem supranationalen Gebilde der Gemeinschaft der Hohen Behörde die Freiheit der Entwicklung lassen und unter Umständen schaffen müssen, deren dieses Organ bedarf. Es wird nicht leicht sein, die Lösung zu finden, aber ich vertraue mit Sicherheit, dass es uns gelingen wird. Die großen Kräfte unseres Zeitalters tragen uns, und was in der kurzen Zeit seit Inkrafttreten des Vertrages über die Montanunion geschehen ist, bestärkt uns in unserer Hoffnung. Mit aufrichtigem Dank vergegenwärtigen wir uns die mühevolle Arbeit aller derer, die an der Schaffung des Vertrages beteiligt waren, vergegenwärtigen wir uns die kühne Konzeption der französischen Regierung, des Herrn Außenministers Schuman und des jetzigen Präsidenten der Hohen Behörde Herrn Monnet, als sie mit dem Plan der Schaffung dieser Union an die europäischen Länder herantraten. Schon seit dem ersten Zusammentreten der Hohen Behörde lässt sich in ihrer Arbeit ein wahrhaft europäischer Geist erkennen. Wir haben auch mit Dank und mit Genugtuung aus der Errichtung der britischen Mission und der Errichtung der Mission der Vereinigten Staaten bei der Hohen Behörde gesehen, dass diese mächtigen Produktionsländer in gemeinsamer Arbeit mit der Montanunion deren Zwecke und Ziele zu fördern bereit sind. Die Zusammenarbeit, die wir aus der Errichtung dieser Missionen erhoffen, wird die jetzt schon so große Bedeutung der Montanunion noch um ein Beträchtliches erhöhen, die Wirtschaft eines sehr erheblichen Teiles der Erde entwickeln und damit zum Wohlstand und zum politischen Einvernehmen in segensreicher Weise beitragen. Die Gemeinschaft für Kohle und Stahl trägt den Namen „Europäische Gemeinschaft für Kohle und Stahl“. Damit ist zum Ausdruck gebracht, dass sie nach der Hoffnung der Gründerstaaten nicht auf diese beschränkt bleiben soll. Wir vertrauen auf die Macht der Entwicklung. Aus dem Bereich der Konstruktion und der Planung ist die Montanunion nunmehr herausgetreten, das Werk selbst, das supranationale Werk hat begonnen. Wir vertrauen darauf, dass die Kraft der Tatsachen die Entwicklung bringt und vorwärts treibt, sei es in dieser, sei es in jener Form. Wir hoffen auf die Kraft dieser Entwicklung noch in einem anderen Sinne. Es ist sehr viel geplant und sehr viel gesprochen worden über die Schaffung Europas. In der Zeit des nationalstaatlichen Denkens war das ein fast verwegener Gedanke, und manchen erschien er utopistisch, wenngleich er die Notwendigkeit, Europa zu schaffen, nicht verkannte. Nunmehr ist der erste Schritt vom Planen in die Wirklichkeit getan. Wie wir zuversichtlich hoffen, beginnt damit für unseren Erdteil eine neue Epoche, eine Epoche des Friedens, der Eintracht und eines neuen Wohlstandes. Es ist eine große Perspektive, die sich vor unserem geistigen Auge eröffnet, und ich bin überzeugt, dass auch hier wieder mancher zu sehr Rückwärtsschauende skeptisch in die Zukunft blickt. Nun, allen Zweiflern sollte das Zustandekommen, das Inslebentreten der Montanunion, die Unterschreibung des Vertrages über die Europäische Verteidigungsgemeinschaft und der damit zusammenhängenden Verträge den Mut und die Zuversicht geben, dass Europa geschaffen werden wird. Ich hoffe, dass die Beratungen und die Beschlüsse des Ministerrats einen weiteren und zwar einen erheblichen Fortschritt bringen werden. Im Interesse des Friedens, im Interesse des Fortschritts müssen wir Europa schaffen, und wir werden Europa schaffen.","Your Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen. In accordance with the provisions of the Treaty establishing the European Coal and Steel Community, the Foreign Ministers and the Economics Ministers of the six contracting countries - Germany, Belgium, France, Italy, Luxembourg and the Netherlands - met today to constitute the Council of Ministers provided for in the treaty and start their work. As the representative of the country that precedes our countries in alphabetical order, I have the honor of being the first President of the Council of Ministers. First of all, I would like to greet the Ministers of the Luxembourg Government and, on behalf of the Council, thank them for the welcome that the City and Country of Luxembourg has given the Community institutions. The inclusion of such institutions brings with it some hardships. I would like to thank the Luxembourgers all the more for taking on these difficulties. I would like to address a particularly warm word of thanks to our colleague Bech, who probably made it possible for us to find a home here in the first place. I greet the President and the members of the High Authority. I am convinced that the Community institutions will work closely together. I also greet the members of the diplomatic corps accredited to the Grand-Ducal Luxembourg Government, as well as the representatives of the United Kingdom and the United States of America Mission to the High Authority, which guarantees its deployment and its close connection between the Community and these two countries. With today's constitution of the Council, after the High Authority began its work a month ago, the second institution of the Community is now in operation. The task that awaits him is great and responsible. It is the federal body of the community. As such, according to the treaty, it has a twofold task. On the one hand, it acts as a community organ, that is, as an organ of the supranational structure, which, endowed with its own sovereign rights, now stands independently alongside the states. As a community body, the council is involved in the organization and administration of sovereign rights which the member states have separated from their area and transferred to the community. In this capacity he is called by the contract to be fully involved in the regulations to be made by the community. He will be heard on all essential measures of the High Authority. In important cases, his approval or decision is necessary. A unanimous resolution is required on particularly significant issues. The Council of Ministers has a second task. It not only represents the interests of the community in the area of ​​the sovereign rights transferred, but also represents the interests of the member states themselves in the area of ​​the sovereign rights remaining to them. This concerns both questions of the general economy as well as other questions of state life, in particular the political questions that are affected by the activities of the coal and steel union, insofar as the states have not transferred their sovereign rights. The Council of Ministers has a liaison and mediator role. It stands at the intersection of two sovereignties, one supranational and one national. It must do justice to the interests of the community in the same way as the interests of the individual states and find a balance that allows both to benefit from theirs. As the treaty says, it must harmonize the interests of both sides. As a body, it is thus given a task that is a problem for everyone who strives for the unification of Europe. Because this agreement cannot consist in creating a European centralism. It must, as the Defense Community Treaty says, take place on a federal or confederate basis, or it will not take place at all. It must take into account both the diversity and the particularity of the individual states, which result from the historical past, as well as the unified summary that is imperative to us as a demand of the future. The work we have done is a bold work. The development of the nation states since the beginning of the 19th century has not promoted the sense of community among the states. Even if the Council of Ministers has to protect the national interests of the member states, it will have to be careful not to regard this task as its priority. Rather, its primary task will be to promote the interests of the community, without which it cannot develop. It will therefore continue to generously allow the supranational structure of the Community of the High Authority the freedom of development and, if necessary, create the circumstances that this organ needs. It will not be easy to find the solution, but I have no doubt that we will. The great forces of our age carry us, and what has happened in the short time since the Treaty on the Coal and Steel Community came into force strengthens our hope. With sincere gratitude, let us remember the hard work of all those who were involved in the creation of the treaty, let us remember the bold conception of the French Government, of Foreign Minister Schuman and the current President of the High Authority, Mr Monnet, when they came up with the plan approached the European countries of the creation of this union. A truly European spirit has been evident in its work since the first meeting of the High Authority. We have also seen with gratitude and satisfaction from the establishment of the British Mission and the establishment of the United States Mission to the High Authority that these powerful producing countries are ready to work together with the Coal and Steel Community to promote its purposes and goals. The cooperation that we hope for from the establishment of these missions will considerably increase the importance of the coal and steel union, which is already so great, develop the economy of a very considerable part of the world and thus contribute to prosperity and political agreement in a beneficial way. The Coal and Steel Community bears the name “European Coal and Steel Community”. This expresses that, according to the hope of the founding states, it should not be limited to these. We trust in the power of development. The Coal and Steel Community has now stepped out of the field of construction and planning, the plant itself, the supranational plant, has begun. We trust that the power of facts will bring development and drive it forward, be it in this form or in that form. We hope for the power of this development in another sense. A lot has been planned and a lot has been said about the creation of Europe. In the time of nation-state thinking, this was an almost daring thought, and to some it appeared utopian, although it did not fail to recognize the need to create Europe. The first step from planning to reality has now been taken. As we confidently hope, a new epoch begins for our continent, an epoch of peace, unity and a new prosperity. It is a great perspective that opens up in our minds' eye, and I am convinced that here too many people who look too backwards look skeptically into the future. Well, the coming about, the coming into existence of the coal and steel union, the signing of the treaty on the European Defense Community and the related treaties should give all doubters the courage and confidence that Europe will be created. I hope that the deliberations and the decisions of the Council of Ministers will bring further and substantial progress. In the interests of peace, in the interests of progress, we must create Europe, and we will create Europe."
10051,"Vijaya Lakshmi Pandit, PGA Inauguration Speech",http://undocs.org/en/A/PV.473,Vijaya Lakshmi Pandit,President of the General Assembly,Inauguration Speech,1953,,"Address by Mrs. Vigya Lakshmi Pandit. President 
of the eighth session of the General Assembly 3. The TEMPORARY PRESIDENT: Though the history of the United Nations is short, we have de veloped some traditions and customs. One such custom is that I should open this new session with a brief statement 4. In doing so, I wish to strike a note of hope: that this gathering, undaunted by the heavy tasks and re sponsibilities confronting it, will in its collective wisdom be able to seize and develop every opportunity that presents itself to promote the cause of peace and in ternational understanding which is the reason for its existence, 5. None of us here will underestimate the difficulties; but, equally, none of us is unaware of the intense yearning of mankind for a break in the clouds that have for too long overshadowed the world. 6. The thought of the millions whose desire is for peace and security will be a spur, if one were needed, for us here to be patient and persevering, to draw strength and faith from the intensity of the support and goodwill that is rightly accorded the United Nations. 7. The success of the negotiations that brought about the end of the war in Indo-China was a demonstration of how the most difficult and menacing conflicts can be halted by the process of negotiation. True those negotia tions were not directly handled by the United Nations. That need not minimize in any way our rejoicing that the fighting was stopped and, with it, the grim cost of casualties and the continuing danger of still greater con flagration. 8. This great event of the current year was an applica tion of United Nations methods for the advancement of United Nations purposes, and we should not cavil that, in this instance, the nations concerned chose to act technically outside the United Nations. 
9. This does not mean, however, that we should en courage neglect of the machinery which we have patient ly built up and which has proved its worth in the solu tion of other major problems. Machinery, in order to be useful, must be kept running. If allowed to remain idle it deteriorates. The same applies to political machinery for peace which we have fashioned out of our collective experience and aspirations. 10. So, within the framework of our Charter, we must continue, step by patient step, to reconcile what differences may still divide us, and to work in fullest harmony on those vital tasks in which the interest of all humanity is one: the elimination of common enemies in the shape of hunger, disease, illiteracy, and sub standard living conditions. 11. On the long agenda now confronting us are several questions that we have grappled with before. The fact that final solutions have eluded us in the past must not discourage us. History is a continuous process, and we must recognize and accept the fact that the United Nations will continue to have problems to cope with, some old, some new. Let us face them with the conviction that here is another chance to advance towards agreement, or at least to narrow the area of existing disagreements. The world expects nothing less from us and it is the responsibility which all Member nations accepted as part of their Charter obligations. 12. The problems confronting the Organization are part and parcel of the troubled times in which we live, a reflection of our world which, while still recovering from the disruption and destruction of global war, has to face new, pressing problems. Some of these spring from human progress itself such as the emergence into national sovereignty of hitherto dependent peoples, and in the vast advances of atomic science and tech nology which, unfortunately, still outstrip man's ability to devise an all-embracing international agreement under which these advances can be directed solely to peaceful purposes. 13. To have been President of the General Assembly is not only a great honour of which I am deeply con scious and appreciative, it also is a vantage point from which the over-all work of an Assembly can be accu rately gauged. 
14. Sometimes it happens that an attempt is made to compute the Assembly's labours mathematically so many meetings held, so many agenda items dealt with, so many words spoken. I prefer to think of the Assembly in terms of positions clarified, misunder standings removed, of principles established, of agree ments reached. Only the exchange of ideas can bring these about, and the process is no less valuable because it entails the risk of revealing differences. 15. The United Nations has done much in many fields to vindicate the hopes of its founders and to justify the support of the peoples in whose name its Charter was written. It is not my intention now to elaborate on the record. But we can say even if the Dressure of events did not demand it--that by the results already achieved, the United Nations has earned the right to continue. 16. It is my earnest hope, as I know it is yours, that these coming weeks of deliberations may mark out the ninth regular session of the General Assembly as one from which Governments and their peoples will draw renewed faith in the spirit of the Organization, confidence in its strength, and conviction of its indispensability as an instrument for the attainment of security and progress in a world of law.

The PRESrpENT: This completes our agenda. Our work is done, and the moment has arrived to close the ninth session of the General Assembly. 131. At the approach of the winter solstice, we wish to prepare for the traditional observances of the season, each according to his religion and tradition, and we all hope to find some rest and relaxation after long and strenuous work. These agreeable prospects are not, however, the only consideration in our minds at this hour. We are sorry to say good-bye to colleagues and friends whom we shall miss more, perhaps, than we realize at this moment. 132. As the servant of the Assembly, these feelings are strong in me. I shall greatly miss your stimulating company. I do not know whether I should praise your constant adherence to the seven-minute rule when explaining votes. But in all seriousness I do pay tribute to your concern for the dignity of the Assembly. Your constant goodwill and sense of co-operation made my work as pleasant and as light as it could be. By and large, and without forgetting that mourning struck us twice, as a session it was, I think, a happy session. - For this I am deeply grateful. I am sorry if I ever hurt anybody's feelings; if sometimes I thought I should intervene, it was done simply because I thought that the rules of the Assembly required it. 133. I think with great appreciation of my contact with the Vice-Presidents, the Chairmen and Vice-Chairmen of the Main Committees, the Rapporteurs and Committee Secretaries. It was as valuable to me as it was cordial. They are entitled, all of them, to the thanks of the Assembly. 134. Most especially-and here I speak not merely in my own name, but very particularly, I know, in the name of all of you-I want to thank our very excellent Secretary-General, whom Iong-reeognized, devoted filial duty has recalled to Sweden, and also all the members of the Secretariat, both those we see and those very numerous ones whom we usually do not see. Their zeal, their sense of duty, their helpfulness, their experience and, above all, their intelligence applied to the business of the Assembly have been one of the mainstays of the session. Mr. Cordier, the Executive Assistant to the Secretary-General, and his able associates of all ranks come in for special acknowledgment on my part. It was a joy to work with them. 135. Let me not omit also to thank those who made our life easy, pleasant and safe. I refer to such services as the elevator personnel, the staff of the dining room and the guards under the command of Mr. Begley. They could not have been more cheerfully helpful. 136. I also want to thank those men and women of the Press, radio and television who have ably and tirelessly conveyed to the people of all countries an account of cur work by the printed word, by pictures and by sound. I would ask them to regard themselves as an indispensable and permanent counterpart of this Organization. We owe a considerable debt of gratitude to them. 137. I· believe we may look with some satisfactiontempered, as is befitting, but still satisfaction-at the results of our labours. There is no point in making a full balance-sheet at this hour. Two things stand out: first, the unanimous resolution on disarmament [resolution 808 (IX)] ; and secondly, that on the peaceful uses of atomic energy [resolution 810 (IX)]. Both correspond to a deep yearning of all nations, for they realize what is at stake. But at the sa.i.; time we have to keep in mind the sober fact that neither resolution constitutes a real beginning in the substantive sense, however modest. They merely mean the removal of such obstacles as had previously stood in the way of a beginning. Even so, no one can deny that they are essential prerequisites for progress to be made in these important fields. May that progress come, and come soon. In a few months, spring will be here and with it fresh hope and a fresh horizon. 138. With a prayer that our work may be abundantly blessed in its results, I shall in a few minutes declare the ninth session of the General Assembly of the United Nations closed.

Gentleman the Leader of the Opposition and all those who have spoken in the House this afternoon – in well-deserved terms – about my right hon. Friend the Member for Woodford (Sir W. Churchill). The right hon. Gentleman the Member for Walthamstow, West (Mr. Attlee) rightly said that this is not the time for us to appraise my right hon. Friend’s work. For one thing, he is, fortunately, still among us; and we all know quite well that whenever he returns to us from his holiday he will still be the dominating figure among us.

But while we admit that this is not the time for such an appraisal, perhaps the House would permit me a very few words on this subject, because for more than sixteen years we have been so intimately associated in political work, and, as it so happens, I have never spoken about this before. As I reflect over those years, and think of them in the terms of what we yet have to do, certain lessons seem to me to stand out for us in the message of what we have done.

First, I think, in work, was my right hon. Friend’s absolute refusal, as his War Cabinet colleagues knew so well, to allow any obstacles, however formidable, to daunt his determination to engage upon some task. With that, courage; and the courage which expresses itself not only in the first enthusiastic burst of fervour but which is also enduring, perhaps the rarer gift of the two.

Although my right hon. Friend has perhaps the widest and most varied interests in life of any man we are likely to know – and that is true – I still think that his great passion was the political life and that he brought to the service of it a most complete vision. No man I have ever known could so make one understand the range of a problem and, at the same time, go straight to its core. I believe that in statesmanship that will be the attribute which many who knew him would place first among his many gifts.

Apart from these things, in spirit there was the magnanimity, most agreeable of virtues; and, let us be frank about it, not one which we politicians find it always easy to practise, although we should all like to do so. In part, perhaps, this was easier with him, because I think he always thought of problems not in abstract terms but in human values; and that was one of the things which endeared him to all this House.

Finally, as has been so well said, there was the humour — the humour based on the incomparable command of the English language, which was so often our delight, not least at Question Time. I am sure that my right hon. Friend will be deeply moved by the things which right hon. and hon. Gentlemen have said of him this afternoon, for he loves this House — loves it in companionship and in conflict.

The right hon. Gentleman the Leader of the Opposition and others have been kind in their welcome to me. I enjoyed very much the Melbourne reflections. The right hon. Gentleman, with his deep knowledge of history, will not, however, have forgotten that Melbourne, although always talking of leaving office, contrived to stay there for a very long time indeed. But I have no desire, I beg him to believe, to emulate that in its entirety. For the rest, I can only say to the right hon. Gentleman and to the Father of the House, too, that I have been deeply touched by what has been said this afternoon and that, for my part, I will do all I can to serve our country."

Chairman of the delegation of Chile 3. The TEMPORARY PRESIDENT (translated from Spanisk): I extend a warm welcome to the representatives of the peoples of the world who, in a spirit of good will have come to this eleventh session of the United Nations General Assembly determined to save mankind from the scourge of war, to reaffirm faith in 
4. Not quite a year ago, I bade you farewell with my faith in the United Nations strengthened. Now I am receiving you with that faith racked by anxiety but not diminished. 5. The tenth session was of outstanding importance, and marked a great step forward along the path of trust. The months that followed were full of promise, but recent dramatic events, deeply to be regretted on all counts, have jeopardized the peace of the world and put the effectiveness of the Organization to the test. 
6. The debates and decisions of the General Assembly meeting in emergency special session are proof that the United Nations has reacted with prudence and justice. This eleventh regular session has the duty, however, not only to safeguard and to supplement those decisions, but also to take the effective measures necessary to ensure their speedy and faithful implementation. 7. The object of world concern and world public opinion is the action of the General Assembly and the Security Council in whatever pertains to the political relations between States, because the peace in the immediate future depends on whether or not those relations are good. 8. We, however, who are convinced that the United Nations is also working gradually to change the course of history and to produce conditions in which world peace cannot be overthrown, must pause briefly to refer to the efficient work so unobtrusively carried on by those many and varied organs, councils or commissions, through which the United Nations contributes to the economic, intellectual, social, industrial, agricultural and human development and to the greater health of the people of the world. It is this great work, so many-sided and effective, which will raise living standards for all men and will someday banish fear. 9. That purpose will never be achieved, however, while the interests of States or individuals take precedence over the notion of their duties and even over an awareness of their rights. 10. If these orgaris persevere in their task, and if the General Assembly and the Security Council continue 
to exercise constant vigilance for the maintenance of peace, the peoples will gradually come to have greater confidence in the work of the United Nations and in the binding force of its decisions. 11. As a living organism which is growing, developing and progressing, the United Nations must gradually adapt itself to changing circumstances. That means that there is an urgent need to embark upon certain changes in the Charter, which the General Assembly did not succeed in doing at the last regular session. Among the necessary changes, there must be an increase in the membership of the councils, particularly of the Security Council and the Economic and Social Council. A mém bership of eleven and eighteen respectively for those two Councils was proportionate to the fifty nations which signed the Charter at San Francisco, but does not adequately represent the seventy-six countries now Members of the Organization, au ! still less the even larger number which will result fm admissions at this and future sessions. Other changes are also necessary, such as the climination of the veto in the Security Council, which will one day have to be undertaken in accordance with the principle of the sovereign equality of all Members, as referred to in the Charter. 12. Over the past eleven years, I have on many occasions acted as representative of a country which has demonstrated its indestructible faith in the United Nations. Now, as I relinquish my duties in a spirit of gratitude, I think that I am entitled to express my sincere and fervent hope that, with God's help, the United Nations will continue and redouble its untiring efforts to achieve human justice and world peace.

This shows that the General Assembly has work to do which takes more time and more continuing effort than previously. 4. The fact is that the eleventh session had to continue the work of the two emergency special sessions in dealing with the tragic situations in the Middle East and in Hlli,gary. The General Assembly prior to the eleventh session had already adopted appropriate resoltuions on those two questions, butthey remained to be implemented. That was the task of the eleventh session. 5. In my speech of acceptance of the high office of President [574th meeting], I expressed my confidence that the United Nations had stood outas an efficient and effective instrument of peace, and in this connexion I paid a warm tribute to the outstanding l'ol~ played by the Secretary-General and his associaten. My confidence has been justified. 6. The resolutions on the questJ.on of the Middle East have been complied with, and this reflects great credit on the part of the Powers concerned. Their compliance redounds' to their honour and good name, and their action is warmly appreciated by the world at large. 7. The Suez Canal was cleared in less time and at less expense than had been expected, and the United Nations is to be congratulated onthisfine performance. 8. It is also a general source of satisfaction that the Government of Egypt has accepted the compulsory jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice in legal disputes arising between the parties to the Convention of 18881/ in respect of the interpretation or application of its provisions. 9. The United Nations Emergency Force hasrendered a signal service to the cause of peace by helping to restore tranquillity in this region. Ithas deservedwell of the United Nations and we owe it a great debt of gratitude. May the tranquillity t.'lusrestored be turned, ""in spite of an overcast horizon, i'lto a more permanent condition of peace in due time. 10. With regard to the HungarianQuestion, compliance with the Assembly resolutions has yet to come. The General Assembly has, by resolution 1133 (XI), appointed me its SpecialRepresentative to negotiate for the achievement of the objectives of those resolutions. Ir:£eed, the freedom of the Hungarian people as a problem of humanity is a cause which all Members of the United Nations should have at heart, and it should be possible to harmonize the actions of nationsto this end. 11. The admission of one more State, the eightysecond, to membership in the United Nations is being recommended: it is the Federation of Malaya, a close neighbour and friend of my country, whose attainment of independence is a tribute to the exemplary application of the principle of self-determination contained in the Charter of the United Nations. 12. The General Assembly, at its eleventh session, called for a peacefulp just and democratic solution for the questions of Algeria and Cyprus, and it is my earnest hope that further progresswill be made toward that end during the twelfth session. 13. Finally, I Wish to reiterate that, ifapositive step forward could be taken in the matter of disarmament, it would be hailed by the whole wO.l'ld. 14. May the twelfth session of the General Assembly, half of whose Member States are represented by their Foreign Ministers, be blessedwith every successin its deliberations for the peace, freedom, justice andwelfare of mankind.

10068,"Dwight D. Eisenhower, Presidential Inauguration Speech",https://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/eisen2.asp,Dwight D. Eisenhower,President (United States),Inauguration Speech,1957,,"THE PRICE OF PEACE

Mr. Chairman, Mr. Vice President, Mr. Chief Justice, Mr. Speaker, members of my family and friends, my countrymen, and the friends of my country, wherever they may be, we meet again, as upon a like moment four years ago, and again you have witnessed my solemn oath of service to you.

I, too, am a witness, today testifying in your name to the principles and purposes to which we, as a people, are pledged.

Before all else, we seek, upon our common labor as a nation, the blessings of Almighty God. And the hopes in our hearts fashion the deepest prayers of our whole people.

May we pursue the right--without self-righteousness.

May we know unity--without conformity.

May we grow in strength--without pride in self.

May we, in our dealings with all peoples of the earth, ever speak truth and serve justice.

And so shall America--in the sight of all men of good will--prove true to the honorable purposes that bind and rule us as a people in all this time of trial through which we pass.

We live in a land of plenty, but rarely has this earth known such peril as today.

In our nation work and wealth abound. Our population grows. Commerce crowds our rivers and rails, our skies, harbors, and highways. Our soil is fertile, our agriculture productive. The air rings with the song of our industry--rolling mills and blast furnaces, dynamos, dams, and assembly lines--the chorus of America the bountiful.

This is our home--yet this is not the whole of our world. For our world is where our full destiny lies--with men, of all people, and all nations, who are or would be free. And for them--and so for us--this is no time of ease or of rest.

In too much of the earth there is want, discord, danger. New forces and new nations stir and strive across the earth, with power to bring, by their fate, great good or great evil to the free world's future. From the deserts of North Africa to the islands of the South Pacific one third of all mankind has entered upon an historic struggle for a new freedom; freedom from grinding poverty. Across all continents, nearly a billion people seek, sometimes almost in desperation, for the skills and knowledge and assistance by which they may satisfy from their own resources, the material wants common to all mankind.

No nation, however old or great, escapes this tempest of change and turmoil. Some, impoverished by the recent World War, seek to restore their means of livelihood. In the heart of Europe, Germany still stands tragically divided. So is the whole continent divided. And so, too, is all the world.

The divisive force is International Communism and the power that it controls.

The designs of that power, dark in purpose, are clear in practice. It strives to seal forever the fate of those it has enslaved. It strives to break the ties that unite the free. And it strives to capture--to exploit for its own greater power--all forces of change in the world, especially the needs of the hungry and the hopes of the oppressed.

Yet the world of International Communism has itself been shaken by a fierce and mighty force: the readiness of men who love freedom to pledge their lives to that love. Through the night of their bondage, the unconquerable will of heroes has struck with the swift, sharp thrust of lightning. Budapest is no longer merely the name of a city; henceforth it is a new and shining symbol of man's yearning to be free.

Thus across all the globe there harshly blow the winds of change. And, we--though fortunate be our lot--know that we can never turn our backs to them.

We look upon this shaken earth, and we declare our firm and fixed purpose--the building of a peace with justice in a world where moral law prevails.

The building of such a peace is a bold and solemn purpose. To proclaim it is easy. To serve it will be hard. And to attain it, we must be aware of its full meaning--and ready to pay its full price.

We know clearly what we seek, and why.

We seek peace, knowing that peace is the climate of freedom. And now, as in no other age, we seek it because we have been warned, by the power of modern weapons, that peace may be the only climate possible for human life itself.

Yet this peace we seek cannot be born of fear alone: it must be rooted in the lives of nations. There must be justice, sensed and shared by all peoples, for, without justice the world can know only a tense and unstable truce. There must be law, steadily invoked and respected by all nations, for without law, the world promises only such meager justice as the pity of the strong upon the weak. But the law of which we speak, comprehending the values of freedom, affirms the equality of all nations, great and small.

Splendid as can be the blessings of such a peace, high will be its cost: in toil patiently sustained, in help honorably given, in sacrifice calmly borne.

We are called to meet the price of this peace.

To counter the threat of those who seek to rule by force, we must pay the costs of our own needed military strength, and help to build the security of others.

We must use our skills and knowledge and, at times, our substance, to help others rise from misery, however far the scene of suffering may be from our shores. For wherever in the world a people knows desperate want, there must appear at least the spark of hope, the hope of progress--or there will surely rise at last the flames of conflict.

We recognize and accept our own deep involvement in the destiny of men everywhere. We are accordingly pledged to honor, and to strive to fortify, the authority of the United Nations. For in that body rests the best hope of our age for the assertion of that law by which all nations may live in dignity.

And, beyond this general resolve, we are called to act a responsible role in the world's great concerns or conflicts-- whether they touch upon the affairs of a vast region, the fate of an island in the Pacific, or the use of a canal in the Middle East. Only in respecting the hopes and cultures of others will we practice the equality of all nations. Only as we show willingness and wisdom in giving counsel--in receiving counsel--and in sharing burdens, will we wisely perform the work of peace.

For one truth must rule all we think and all we do. No people can live to itself alone. The unity of all who dwell in freedom is their only sure defense. The economic need of all nations--in mutual dependence--makes isolation an impossibility; not even America's prosperity could long survive if other nations did not also prosper. No nation can longer be a fortress, lone and strong and safe. And any people, seeking such shelter for themselves, can now build only their own prison.

Our pledge to these principles is constant, because we believe in their rightness.

We do not fear this world of change. America is no stranger to much of its spirit. Everywhere we see the seeds of the same growth that America itself has known. The American experiment has, for generations, fired the passion and the courage of millions elsewhere seeking freedom, equality, and opportunity. And the American story of material progress has helped excite the longing of all needy peoples for some satisfaction of their human wants. These hopes that we have helped to inspire, we can help to fulfill.

In this confidence, we speak plainly to all peoples.

We cherish our friendship with all nations that are or would be free. We respect, no less, their independence. And when, in time of want or peril, they ask our help, they may honorably receive it; for we no more seek to buy their sovereignty than we would sell our own. Sovereignty is never bartered among freemen.

We honor the aspirations of those nations which, now captive, long for freedom. We seek neither their military alliance nor any artificial imitation of our society. And they can know the warmth of the welcome that awaits them when, as must be, they join again the ranks of freedom.

We honor, no less in this divided world than in a less tormented time, the people of Russia. We do not dread, rather do we welcome, their progress in education and industry. We wish them success in their demands for more intellectual freedom, greater security before their own laws, fuller enjoyment of the rewards of their own toil. For as such things come to pass, the more certain will be the coming of that day when our peoples may freely meet in friendship.

So we voice our hope and our belief that we can help to heal this divided world. Thus may the nations cease to live in trembling before the menace of force. Thus may the weight of fear and the weight of arms be taken from the burdened shoulders of mankind.

This, nothing less, is the labor to which we are called and our strength dedicated.

And so the prayer of our people carries far beyond our own frontiers, to the wide world of our duty and our destiny.

May the light of freedom, coming to all darkened lands, flame brightly--until at last the darkness is no more.

May the turbulence of our age yield to a true time of peace, when men and nations shall share a life that honors the dignity of each, the brotherhood of all."
10069,"Harold Macmillan, PM Inauguration Speech",http://www.britishpoliticalspeech.org/speech-archive.htm?speech=107,Harold Macmillan,Prime Minister (United Kingdom),Inauguration Speech,1957,,"My Lord Chairman, I need not tell you how glad we are to see you among us this afternoon. This vast audience has already demonstrated the affection and esteem in which our Party holds you and will always hold you. Since the last Mass Meeting of the Conservative Conference we have lived through a difficult and tumultuous year, even judged by the standards of this modern age. It speaks much for the strength of the Conservative and Unionist Party and the basic loyalty and steadfastness of all our people that we have overcome so many troubles and are facing the future today with such resolution and confidence. Everyone in this hall will I am sure understand the somewhat mixed feelings with which I approach my task today.

First, I need not hide it from you, pride at the honour which the Party has done me in electing me their leader; next, humility, when I think of the magnitude of my responsibilities; finally sorrow that the leadership should have come to me in the way it did, through the illness and retirement of my friend and colleague Anthony Eden. But to these I must frankly add a sense of inspiration at the challenge of the great issues at home and abroad.

Once again, as twice in my lifetime, we shall only overcome them by unity and daring. I have naturally drawn great comfort and strength from the support of my colleagues in the Government, from our Members of Parliament, and from all of you in this hall who give the Party its direction and vigour in the constituencies throughout the country.

In the course of this Conference you have heard speeches from most of the leading Ministers. I am sure you must be impressed by the grasp of the subject and the breadth of vision which they have displayed. You have heard the Foreign Secretary and shown the confidence and support you have for him amid his heavy responsibilities. You have heard the Chancellor of the Exchequer and been able to admire the courage he is displaying in facing his onerous tasks. There is one, alas, of my colleagues who has not been able to be here, the Home Secretary. We are indeed sorry that he is not with us but it is good to learn that he is heading towards full recovery, for the Party owes him more than it can ever repay.

Now I come to the Party. Here again I want to thank two men particularly. Oliver Poole, who has been a wonderful help to me ever since I first became leader; who kept his head clear and his heart loyal during the first months of difficulty and who has shown a real sense of duty and team spirit in continuing to serve us in that part of our work where he can give us the greatest help. And now I come to Lord Hailsham. I do not think I need say very much about him. He speaks for himself - and very well. I would like to say this. He did not seek this post. He did not want it. Beneath a certain buoyancy which we all love in him, there lies a sincere modesty. He did not think he could do it. But when I pressed him, he finally replied, as I expected, that he would do anything that I asked him to do to the best of his ability. When I told him of Oliver Poole’s generous proposal, then indeed many of the new Chairman’s anxieties were removed. Together they will make a fine team Give them all your support.

Now, I come to this Conference. But before I do so, I am sure you would wish me to express our gratitude to Sir Stephen Pierssené who has served us well and long. We hope he may have many happy years of activity, but perhaps in a less strenuous sphere. At the same time I would like to welcome his successor, Mr. Urton, who is no stranger to most of us.

Now, for the Conference. It has been an inspiring Conference. I think I remember saying on one of these occasions that it was a happy dispensation of Providence that decreed that the Conservative Party Conference should always take place a week after the Socialist Party Conference. At least it makes it easy for the country to draw its own conclusions. There is hardly any need to underline the contrast: ‘To point the moral or adorn the tale.’

This week the keynote of our Conference has been that combination of realism and idealism, so difficult to attain but without which no human organisation has the right to live, or the power to survive. No one who has been here and heard the wide-ranging and thoughtful debates, or read them in the newspapers, or listened on the radio, or looked at the television, can fail to realise that this is a modern twentieth century Party: a Party drawn from every section of the Nation; a Party with the largest youth organisation; a Party which, while resting its foundations in the past, is building for the future; a Party seeking real solutions to modern problems, seeking them with determination, with knowledge and, as is your right, with a certain amount of criticism. I am all for criticism. We cannot just live by patting each other on the back. But we have never gone in for stabbing each other in the back. I read during the recess that Mr. Gaitskell was suffering from a crick in the neck. I was very sorry, but not at all surprised. Looking over your shoulder is the occupational disease of left wing leaders. Here, at any rate, we look each other in the face.

I want to speak first about the outside world - what used to be called foreign affairs. But really that phrase is out of date. In old days foreign affairs meant something remote, rather mysterious, only understood by a few experts. Now we have learnt only too well that our fortunes at home are inextricably linked with the world outside, financially, economically, materially, morally. This modern world in which we live is dominated by three great facts. The fact of Communism; the fact of the new nationalism; and the fact of nuclear power and modern technology with all their immense possibilities for good and for evil.

We were brought up to divide history into times of peace, sometimes secure, sometimes less secure, but still peace; and times of war. But Communism has changed all that. It has destroyed the old distinction. It is a continual war. Cold war we call it, a never-ending struggle between two opposing forces. To most of us it is the struggle between good and evil. But when we say this, we must try to live up to our claim. The challenge to freedom does not only come from abroad. At any rate, we all know the weapons of Communism, both at home and abroad. Propaganda and intimidation to weaken the West by fear, subversion of areas where our vital interests are at stake, and the perversion and arming of nationalism to serve Communist ends. We have to resist these tactics by every means in our power.

At the same time we have to seek - and we are honestly seeking - some kind of an answer by which the danger until it can be finally removed can at least be contained. Peaceful coexistence is fine so long as it is really peaceful, and each side is prepared to live together without trying to undermine the other by plot and intrigue. Yet we must not deceive ourselves as to the nature of this struggle. It is, I fear, one of those great secular divisions from which the world has suffered in the past and which now takes a new and dangerous form. We must be patient as well as prudent. For the conflict is moral as well as material. To meet it we must assess calmly the aims and methods of those who confront us. We must meet any goodwill with equal goodwill. But we must avoid wishful thinking which would accept mere words and phrases at their face value. Deeds, not words, these are the only reality. Above all, we must not lower our guard, nor underrate our own strength. We must certainly not undermine it ourselves.

We have, as I see it, a triple shield. First, there is the community of purpose and moral influence of our own Commonwealth of Nations. Second, there is the growing solidarity of Western Europe. Third, there is our alliance with the United States. One of the great though quiet achievements of the past few months has been the recognition in London and Washington that we must act together. In the Far Eastern troubles of 1954, America insisted on the peril. She was then prepared to go it alone, but we were for restraint. Then a year ago America thought that we had been too hasty over Suez. To us, it seemed that they were too slow to understand what was really involved.

The Communists, of course, still hope to divide us; and if they can do that, their task will be easy. Of course, there are plenty of people who are tempted to harp upon and exaggerate our occasional differences. But I must say frankly that if they do so, they are wittingly or unwittingly playing the Communist game. For on the unity of purpose and policy of the Commonwealth, Europe and the United States lies the hope and the only hope of the free world.

There is one vital aspect of defence in which America and Britain are jointly determined. It is well for the world that that has been so. I mean, of course, the nuclear bomb. This is a matter which needs calmness of judgment as well as imagination; sense as well as sensibility. Nobody can deny that it has been the Western possession of the bomb which has deterred and still deters the Soviet Union from open aggression. Even the most recent developments, however startling, have not altered this strategic fact. It is our will to retaliate with nuclear strength which prevents them daring to launch their enormous forces against us. And it is for this reason that during this year I, with the full support of my colleagues, have resisted all the pressure from so many sources to abandon the manufacture and testing of our weapon without any safeguards for our own security. The pressure was very severe; some of it, of course, was not respectable - it came from Communist or Communist-inspired sources. I did not mind that, but much of it came from the most worthy and high-minded men and women - whose views I naturally respect. But events have shown how wise my colleagues and I were to stand firm, and not to send our Foreign Secretary in the words used in this hall a week ago, ‘naked into the Conference Chamber.’

The story, you know, was told of Wilkes, the great 18th Century demagogue and agitator, that when in his more respectable and declining years he was speaking to the King, the Monarch was surprised at his moderation. ‘Ah!’ said Wilkes, ‘I was never much of a Wilkite myself.’

I am beginning to think that Mr. Bevan was never much of a Bevanite. Of course, I must admit that the second Socialist resolution last week asking us to undertake no more nuclear tests seemed rather to undermine the first. It seemed to take us back to Mr. Gaitskell’s original idea that we should make the bomb but not test it. I never thought that a very prudent plan. But no doubt this was a tactical concession to the extremists. In any case, our position is clear. We want to end the testing and production of nuclear weapons, but we want to make sure that if we make such an agreement it can and will be enforced. But getting rid of the bomb is not enough. At the same time we must have some reduction of conventional forces.

We want, of course, to free the world from the shadow of the nuclear threat. But we cannot give up our deterrent if as a result we are left in a position of hopeless weakness and inequality in conventional forces.

We and our allies have made one proposal after another. They take full account of Soviet security as well as of our own - that is the only way. As yet, so far we have had no real response. We have had nothing but propaganda arguments. But we do not despair. We shall go on trying. Meanwhile, so long as we have the retaliatory power I do not believe that a mass assault by the Soviet forces upon us is practicable. Sir Winston Churchill pointed out that in the stalemate may lie the hope of avoiding global war. Yet we have to accept this fact that if Communism is checked in that way, it will turn to other methods. We have to meet subversion in all its various forms. We must help our friends all over the world who are in danger.

All this means a long and sustained effort. We must not overstrain ourselves. We must not exhaust our economy in Britain by attempting too much. Nothing would suit the Communist powers better or serve our allies worse. That is the purpose of our new defence plan. We believe that we can best fulfil our tasks both in the deterrent and in what we have called the police work that falls upon us from time to time all over the world by well-equipped volunteer forces. We have always said that we would dispense with National Service as soon as it became possible to do so. That is our aim. Industry will of course benefit when the call-up stops.  The whole economy will benefit and we should be able to look to our great tradition of volunteer service to match the nation’s needs.

For the moment the Soviet advance has been halted in Europe. The powerful organisation of NATO stands firm. In the Far East, SEATO has come into being and the situation, though precarious, is less anxious than it was a year or two ago. It is natural therefore that checked in two directions the Communist flood should have sought the weakest point - that has been and still is the Middle East.

A year ago when we ascribed much of the troubles of the Middle East to Russian infiltration our analysis was questioned and even ridiculed. I do not think anyone would question it today. Recent events in Syria have shown how persistent Communist subversion can be. One of the great gains of recent months is that our American friends are now determined in close collaboration with us to do all they can to assist and aid the countries of the Middle East. For I am persuaded that it is in the interests of these countries as well as our own that the economic co-operation and friendly relations which have done so much to build up their freedom in the past should be strengthened and not weakened. For it is by this honourable partnership that the standard of the countries of the Middle East and their strength can be continually improved. Soviet infiltration and interference would in the long run prove a menace to both. We trust that the Middle Eastern peoples will see the danger to themselves, that they will discover before it is too late that the Communists who charge us with ‘colonialism’ are themselves the cruellest imperialists.

Let us remind the world that the Iron Curtain has gathered behind its sinister folds no less than a hundred million people in Europe alone since the end of the war. Britain, during that time or in the same period, has helped five times that number - about five hundred million people - in Asia and Africa to achieve nationhood as full and free members of the Commonwealth. The free Commonwealth is our answer to the claims and problems of growing nationalism. What was Communism’s answer? What is it today? It can be summed up in a single word - Hungary. Therefore, while the world outside is full of dangers and difficulties, let us take heart. Let us hold on together. Above all let us hold together the three groups of nations of which we are the only country to be a member of all - the Commonwealth, Europe, and the Anglo-American Alliance.

Only thus can we do our duty by our own peoples and by the United Nations, whose principles we are all pledged to serve and whose authority we seek all the time to strengthen. Yet, if we are to discharge our duty in the world, our power to do so must depend above all upon our domestic economic strength. I believe we have the will, although, of course, there are faint hearts and defeatists everywhere in every country. What we must ensure is that not only that we have the ends but that we have the means. Our foreign policy must rest upon the strength of our economy.

Now I come to a question with which you have dealt. One problem has troubled us both at home and abroad. It is the problem of inflation. So much has been said in this hall during this week that you will not expect me to repeat it. Our great pre-war problem was unemployment.  Our great post-war problem has been inflation.  Before the war, under Conservative and Labour Governments alike, there were many men and women unemployed. There were machines standing idle.  In those days prices were low but unemployment was high. Today we have full employment. In most years, since the war, we have had a labour shortage; that is to say, more jobs in industry than men and women to fill them. All this has brought with it the problem of rising prices. This has confronted both Parties since the war - and many other countries besides our own.

Our first responsibility, therefore, is to see that inflation does not undermine our economic position or endanger the expansion of our economy. We have had our successes. In spite of all our difficulties we have achieved as a nation a good surplus in balance of payments. This year it will be some £200,000,000. We have invested heavily overseas, and of course in our capacity as bankers to the sterling area we have had to meet heavy drawings on the central reserves from the rapidly developing countries of the Commonwealth. Meanwhile, at home we have reached, so far as the mass of the people are concerned, the highest standard of living in our history.

I see that Mr. Bevan called the people ‘an embittered and frustrated industrial mass.’ I do not know where he got that impression from. Has he never seen any of those six million TV aerials which have gone up since 1951? Has he never run across any of the extra two million cars or motor bicycles? Does his view not embrace any of those houses he did not build but we did?

Let us be frank. The wage earner and the business man find wages and profits go far above prices. It is the pensioner, the retired man, the people on fixed or nearly fixed incomes, who have borne the burden. I said at Bedford recently, and I say again today, we have a clear duty to those sections of our people who have not shared in this general prosperity and that duty we intend to discharge.

This is, of course, a many-sided problem. We are not merely an industrial country; we are the bankers to the sterling area. From this we gain great advantages. It helps us, but it brings corresponding risks and responsibilities. The fact that the greater part of the world’s trade is done in our money means that our money can be vulnerable. Our policies must command confidence not only in this country but abroad. And confidence in our money is affected not only by events in this country but also by what is happening abroad. During this summer the pound suffered because people abroad feared that the British Government and people would not boldly face the problems of inflation or of extra wage claims not matched by extra production. It also suffered, and perhaps to a greater degree, because people abroad believed that the German deutschmark was undervalued and saw a hope of a quick capital profit by buying marks. Let us try to get this in perspective for a moment.

In 1951 we took over this country in a state of extreme - almost desperate - crisis. The Socialist Government was so frightened of the situation that they did not even try to deal with it. They had not the courage for that - they ran away from it. It is true they summoned Parliament - but only to dissolve it. We certainly do not mean to run away from our responsibilities. After the first year, when we had to follow and intensify measures of restriction, import controls and the like, we have developed a policy of expansion through freedom, opportunity and incentive - and this coupled with a continuing reduction in the burden of taxation. Monetary policy, restriction or easing of credit, acceleration or retardation in this or that part of the investment programme over which the Government has direct control - surely these are the measures which we must intensify or relax according to the state of the economic barometer.

Nor must we forget the human element. Incentive is necessary if we are to get real expansion, and that is why we have made tax reductions amounting in all to some £800,000,000 or £900,000,000 a year. Nevertheless, when the boom in investment developed in 1955, bringing a danger of renewed inflation, we brought in measures designed to get people to hold back on buying and save more. The credit squeeze helped to restrain the boom within the limits of our resources, restrictions on hire-purchase damped down a bit the spending out of borrowed money. National savings were assisted by higher interest rates, income tax concessions on small saving, and - dare I remind you of it - the launching of the premium bond.

These policies took, of course, some time to work, but they did work. And the result is that we have now a decent surplus on our balance of payments. We have increased both exports and savings to record levels. But the threat today does not come from a shortage of money of the type that led to unemployment between the wars. It is really no good trying to revive the bogey of Mr. Montagu Norman. Everyone is fully employed - indeed, there is, if anything, a shortage of labour. The danger does not come from too little money in the system. It comes from too much. In other words from inflation.

Of course, the Government could, but will not in principle, allow money, paper money - for that is what it is - to be created to ensure that, for the time being, the spiral of wages and prices goes merrily up.  But who gains? The wage earner won’t gain in the long run, and all the rest of the community will lose. The spiral won’t keep on going up - sooner or later it will blow up. Then all will lose in a common disaster, in which the trade by which we live, our savings of the past, and our hopes for the future would all be involved. This is where the real threat of unemployment lies - not in the Government’s measures to deal with the problem.

There is another misunderstanding I would like to clear up. It is not true to say that there is a freeze on private investment. Private investment can be financed in three ways - either by bank overdraft, by internal savings of a company, or by raising fresh capital from the public. The first certainly cannot be increased because the bank overdrafts are to be held on average to last year’s figures, and these are forms of money that are in a sense creating money. The second depends upon the wise and prudent policy of those who direct industry. The third, raising money on the market, depends upon what is judged to be the capacity of the market to absorb it, which is another way of saying, upon the willingness of people to save. I am sure we must aim to match our investment by genuine saving. And if more is saved, why then, more can be invested. In the same way, if more is produced more can be earned - and should be earned. What we cannot afford is more to be paid out, unrelated to higher production.

The Chairman has said something about the wicked accusation that we seek to impose unemployment. There may be some people - there must be in this audience - young enough not to have known, there may be some so remote from reality not to realise what mass unemployment involves in human suffering. Certainly anyone of my age, or who has had my experience can never put it out of his mind. We do not seek unemployment - we seek to avert it. And if it ever comes to the people of this country again, it can only come in one way - it will be a self-inflicted wound. Our aim is not to create unemployment and I think our record proves it.

Our aim is not to reduce living standards in any section of our people. On the contrary, our fixed purpose is to raise them for all. Our aim is not conflict but unity. Whatever extremists may say, I would urge ordinary men and women of every section of the community to put out of their minds all appeals to prejudice. But I must say this frankly - and it is my duty to say it - that unless we can show common sense all round we may by ill-considered words and deeds throw away the substance for the shadow like the dog in the fable.

I cannot believe that our people will make the tragic mistake of throwing away the solid benefits which they have gained and the still more substantial benefits which are within our grasp. Surely what we all ought to be doing now is seeing how we can produce a bit more, not seeing how we can chisel a bit more out of somebody else. I believe that, if they think it over, all those who hold great responsibility, either for the leadership and management of business, or the Trade Unions, will have this thought in mind. In any case, our duty as the Government is clear. In spite of misunderstanding and misrepresentation, we intend to see this thing through. Then our policies will be seen not only to be necessary but fruitful. Meanwhile, I feel sure that we can look to you in this hall, and to all those whom you represent and influence outside, for full and active support.

We have seen a good many things through in the last six years. Cast your minds back for a moment. In a fortnight’s time Britain will have had a Conservative Government for six years. Six years of Socialist restriction compared with six years of Conservative opportunity, so we can strike a balance sheet.

First, our trading account with the rest of the world. In their six years the Socialists were £800,000,000 in the red. In our six years we are £800,000,000 to the good. We have been earning abroad more than we have been spending and we are doing so now. And we have been investing far more 50 per cent more - half as much again more - overseas than the Socialists did - and that, in spite of the 6,000 million dollars’ worth which they have received in gifts alone. And we have been investing more at home. And even with our new measures will go on doing so. In six years the Socialists built less than a million houses. In six Conservative years nearly twice as many have been completed. For every single school place completed by the Socialists we have completed two. Take the records on taxation. In five Socialist Budgets taxes went up. In five Conservative Budgets taxes have come down. Then look at the difference in the standard of living: one doesn’t need statistics to demonstrate this - the evidence is all around us. Abundance of goods and freedom of choice. It took us less than three years to get rid of food rationing which had persisted through six long Socialist years.

You will remember the gibe about ‘Red Meat.’ What has happened? I will tell you. The gibe has become the joint. Mr. Bevan once said, ‘Why look in the crystal when you can read the book?’ Well, you can read in the book the comparison between the record of the Socialist and of the Conservative Governments. The facts are all there and six years is a fair period of trial. The trouble is that it is so easy to forget what things were like back in 1951. And, of course, we are such a young Party that many of us do not know.

It is easy to forget how we had to take a bit of margarine with us when we went to tea with a friend, how eagerly we queued for what I think was called a bit of off-ration offal, or that strange part of bureaucratic thinking - bananas on green books only. People in those days could not buy nylons except under the counter or from the spivs; we had to dash round looking for candles every time there was a power cut. And even after six years of enlightened Socialism - six years of this Utopia - the Minister of Fuel and Power proudly made this statement. He said: ‘Electric fires are a major cause of power cuts. We have imposed a purchase tax on them, and the Area Boards no longer display them in showrooms. I am told that in many parts of the country it is becoming really difficult to buy an electric fire.’ What a boast! What a triumph of planning!

That was in October 1951. It was in that same month that the Socialist Prime Minister said: ‘If rationing is good for the people in wartime, surely it must be good for them in peacetime.’ All these things are part and parcel of Socialism. But - and I must be serious - these things are not just a glimpse of the past. They are an awful warning for the future.

In due course the British people will be called upon to make a great decision. When that time comes it will be their duty to put aside many of the minor incidents or temporary difficulties, or even grievances, that naturally arise in the life of any country.  It will be true next time, as it was last time and the time before that - to borrow a phrase from our old friend Anthony Eden - that the broad divide in our political life is between Socialism and freedom, between those who accept the doctrine that the State should dominate the life of the individual and those who believe in the highest degree of individual freedom compatible with an ordered community and the common good.

That is still the choice today, and will be in two or three years hence. The people have the right to be informed, and a duty to inform themselves as to the real meaning of the programmes set before them. They have to decide, moreover, partly on hard practical grounds - what will best suit their material fortune and prosperity - and partly, if I may be allowed the word, on spiritual grounds, on what best suits the ideals and ambitions that they have for themselves - aye, their children and their fellow countrymen - their country.

Let us take first the practical grounds. Our economy, under whatever Government, Left or Right, will have to live in a harshly competitive world. It will have to develop its own strength without the great benefit of the legacy of wealth which has been largely destroyed in two world wars. What are the proposals so far set before us by the Socialists? They pay lip service, of course, to the defence of the pound.  But how do they propose to defend it against the continual pressure to increase wages, regardless of production? First, by the purchase of some 5 million houses, now in private hands, at a cost of perhaps something like £2,500,000,000.  But to turn fixed assets into liquid money hardly seems a very good method of steadying prices or resisting inflation. Then they do it by a series of controls, presumably combined with rationing? That will only bring us back all the frustration and misery, aye, and dishonesty, from which we have recently escaped. They do it by immense increases in public expenditure and so taxation. Will that help? Will they do it by an attack upon industry upon a scale undefined and apparently practically without limits?

There has been a great ideological dispute as to precisely which form of nationalisation was to be preferred, the old or the new.  I think the supporters of the new felt that the word nationalisation was not very popular. They came to Brighton not to praise it but to bury it. But really it has all amounted, as far as I can see, to a distinction without a difference. They are using the oldest trick in the world - if the goods do not sell - try them with another label. I read in a Socialist magazine the following account of this dispute: ‘The real choice’ it says, ‘is whether the Government is to use public ownership to take a cut in the swag or to use public enterprise to cut the swag itself.’ This is an elegant way of describing these two proposals which have caused such a furore in the Labour Party. All the same, it seems that a compromise was reached, and it was decided to use both methods. There is to be a short list who are to have their throats cut, and a longer list who are to be bled slowly to death.

Let me turn for a moment to their foreign policies, which are even more obscure. Some support the principle of the alliances; others oppose it violently. Some are in favour of Britain being armed with atomic and nuclear deterrents; others oppose it bitterly. Some are for the American alliance; others against. Some see in Communism the deadly enemy of all free society; others believe it to be something that can be soothed or flattered or wheedled into harmlessness.

We are convinced, and I firmly believe we can convince the mass of our fellow countrymen, that these Socialist theories will not work, that they have been proved not to work, and that they would bring about an early collapse of the whole structure on which we have built up in recent years so much prosperity for all. What is more - I do not believe that anyone really wants that kind of society. Where everything is rationed, where houses are municipalised, where education is uniform, where industry is nationalised, where individual effort is hobbled and derided and where taxes are sky-high. Think of all the bills piling up for the unfortunate Socialist Chancellor of the Exchequer. I see that Mr. Harold Wilson has earmarked himself for that job - well, I would not like to be in his boots.

But we on our side must not be content with destructive criticism. We shall succeed if we have - and are clearly seen to have - ideas and policies both at home and abroad which match the possibilities of our time. We Conservatives have a pattern of policy: that pattern has clearly emerged throughout the last six years. Inevitably, the difficulties of recent months, the recurrence of inflation at home, and the Middle Eastern crisis abroad, have somewhat obscured this pattern in the minds of many people. In the maze of events some have lost the thread. But it has not been broken. The pattern is there. It is our special duty - every one of us in this hall - to let it clearly be seen in every constituency throughout the land.

Let me try to give its general outline. Abroad we hold to the policy of peace through strength with our friends in the Commonwealth, our allies in the great regional organisations, and our American partners. At the same time we will do all that negotiation and ingenuity can contrive to turn this policy into one of real peace through adequate disarmament with proper safeguards.

I believe the mass of the people broadly understand this policy and approve it. They understand, too, the modern role of the Commonwealth, changing and developing all the time. They understand the economic value of the Commonwealth as well as its moral value - they want to invest in it and help in its development. And they well know what the world would be like, with the pressures of Communism and the dangers of extreme nationalism, if this Commonwealth of ours did not exist both as a fact and as an ideal.

At home, our aim ever since we took over in the crisis of 1951 has been the same - to build a strong, expanding economy, built to sustain our worldwide responsibilities, built to compete in the markets of the world, and built year by year to raise the standard of living of the people.

Expansion and freedom, trade and progress, remain our main theme and objective, and it is to these that our individual policies are geared. For instance, our Free Trade Area proposals which you debated here yesterday have the aim of increasing our trade with Europe, while safeguarding the interests of our domestic agriculture and of the British Commonwealth. For Europe is the area of the world where trade is expanding the most rapidly, and it is from Europe that the duty of the Old World to meet some of the needs of the new and developing territories can best be met. Our agriculture must continue in good heart and play its part in the new conditions of freedom and abundance. The policy of long-term assurances and improvement grants embodied in our new Agriculture Act will give a sounder basis for farmers than ever before on which to plan ahead.

With regard to Commonwealth trade, you will have read the brilliantly successful way in which the Chancellor of the Exchequer, with his Commonwealth colleagues, has brought to a conclusion the Conference in Canada. And we have given the warmest welcome, and, I trust, some new ideas of our own, as a most constructive contribution to the Prime Minister of Canada’s determination to increase trade between Canada and the Old Country.

We need more power, hence our rapidly developing nuclear power programme, which will be pressed forward on the maximum scale our economy can sustain under the able direction of the Minister in charge. We need young men and women, qualified to handle the new processes and techniques which modern science develops day by day. Hence our rapidly developing nuclear power programme, which will be pressed forward on the maximum scale our economy can sustain under the able direction of the Minister in charge.

We need young men and women, qualified to handle the new processes and techniques which modern science develops day by day. Hence the £100,000,000 expansion of technical education. But, you know, for all their importance, these questions of how to earn our living are but a means to an end - living itself.

Our Party stands for the combination of two principles; the rights of the individual - freedom, let us call it - and his duties. Every man comes into this world alone. He goes out of it alone. Although the life of man on earth is spent in a community, to which each man owes obligations, fundamentally he is a single, individual soul, alone before his Maker.

All through human society there has been this inherent problem of how to combine the rights of each individual man and woman, their right to live their own lives, to express themselves in their own way and to make or, if you like, to mar their own fortunes, how to combine that with the duty that they have to others and the benefits that they can bring to others. A Socialist society, or a collectivist society, would not provide a high standard of material conditions for a people who have no raw materials save coal and a little iron; who brought into being an immense population in a confined compass; and who can only live by their intelligence, their brains and by the constant development of new methods - which spring after all in the long run from individual human brains.

When I spoke on the occasion of my election as your leader some months ago, I said that it is only by giving opportunity to the strong and able that we can have the means to protect the weak and the old. The whole fabric of our social services - slum clearance, health services, insurance benefits, pensions, education and the rest - is nurtured and sustained by the success of individual enterprise and effort. Encourage that enterprise, and these social services will expand in increasing scope and usefulness. But damp it down, penalise it, and inevitably the social services will wilt and wither. But even if that were not so, even if Socialism could provide every material benefit, I do not believe that it offers the kind of life suited to a people of our long tradition of freedom and civilisation. Man was not made for the State, the State was made for man; and there, fundamentally, lies the difference between the approach of our two philosophies. I have no doubt at all that if we can but make these principles known and understood, which way will fall the choice of the great majority of our fellow countrymen."

Sie wissen dass unser vor zwei Jahren gefasster Entschluss, der Nato beizutreten Kritiker gefunden hat und noch findet, vor allem auf der anderen Seite des Eisernen Vorhanges. Die Bundesregierung und die Mehrheit des Parlaments stehen wie nur jemals zu diesem Entschluss. Ich will die Gründe dazu kurz darlegen. Die leitenden Staatsmänner Sowjetrusslands raten bei jeder Gelegenheit von den Realitäten auszugehen. Nun gut betrachten wir einmal die Realitäten unserer Zeit. Es ist eine nur zu reale Tatsache, dass die Sowjetunion rund 5 Millionen Soldaten, seit 1945 mit nur geringen Schwankungen unter Waffen hält, dass insbesondere 22 Divisionen in der sowjetisch besetzten Zone Deutschlands stehen. Divisionen die heute rund 7500 moderne Panzer zur Verfügung haben, fast dreieinhalbtausend mehr als vor zwei Jahren. Ich kann darin nur eine ständige, latente Bedrohung sehen und ich bin überzeugt, dass jeder verantwortliche Staatsmann zu jeder anderen Zeit, eine solch gewaltige Truppenmacht in seinem Nachbarland ebenfalls als bedrohliche Realität für sein Land aufgefasst hätte. Den eben genannten Zahlen kann ich weitere eindrucksvolle Zahlen über die sowjetische Luftwaffe, UBootflotte oder über das sowjetische Atombombenpotenzial hinzufügen und in der Aufrechterhaltung einer solchen Streitmacht, meine Herren, sehe ich eine sehr ernste Realität. Die zweite Realität unserer Zeit ist, dass die sowjetischen Führer, den Glauben an ihre Mission, nämlich die ganze Welt kommunistisch zu machen nicht aufgegeben haben. Sie haben dazu inzwischen in vielen Reden wiederholt und immer noch werden in der Sowjetunion Lenins Werke gelehrt, der sagte: „Wenn das Proletariat einen Krieg führt um den Kommunismus zu stärken oder auszubreiten, dann ist ein solcher Krieg berechtigt und ein heiliger Krieg“. Und an anderer Stelle: „Wir Marxisten waren immer und sind immer für einen revolutionären Krieg gegen die konterrevolutionären Völker“. Wir brauchen nur in den Atlas und das Geschichtsbuch zusehen, wo waren die Grenzen der Sowjetunion im Jahre 39, wo sind sie heute. Im Jahre 40 fielen Estland, Lettland, Litauen, der Überfall auf Finnland misslang. Bei Kriegsende annektierte die Sowjetunion, die früher jeden Territorialgewinn als Imperialismus zu brandmarken pflegte, Teile Finnlands, Polens, Rumäniens, der Tschechoslowakei und Ostpreußens. Immer weiter drang die Sowjetunion nach Westen vor. Überall dort wo sowjetische Truppen standen, wurden kommunistische Regierungen gebildet. In Polen, Rumänien, Bulgarien, Albanien, Ungarn, der Tschechoslowakei, der sowjetischen Besatzungszone Deutschlands. Meine Herren das ist die dritte Realität. Die feste Haltung der NATO hat die Sowjetunion davon überzeugt, dass jedes weitere Vordringen zu militärischen Gegenmaßnahmen der atlantischen Allianz führen würde. Vor zwei Jahren trat die Bundesrepublik dem Nordatlantikpakt bei. Wir übernahmen die Aufgabe, zum Schutze unseres Gebiets und des Westens, eigene Streitkräfte aufzustellen, weil wir es für selbstverständlich halten, dass die Bundesrepublik als souveräner Staat, mit eigene Truppen zur gemeinsamen Verteidigung ihres Gebiets und des Westens beitragen muss. Die Bundesregierung, meine Herren, hat den Willen ihren vollen Beitrag zu leisten, wir müssen unsere Sicherheit stärken und das apokalyptische Verhängnis eines modernen Krieges abwenden. Dass ein moderner atomarer Krieg ein apokalyptisches Verhängnis sein würde, nicht nur für die Bevölkerung der Bundesrepublik und des Westens, sondern für die gesamte Menschheit, einschließlich der Völker des Sowjetblocks, das wissen wir alle. Mit wachsender Sorge beobachten wir die Haltung der sowjetischen Regierung gegenüber dem schwersten Problem vor das die Geschichte unsere Generation gestellt hat. Ich fürchte die Führer der Sowjetunion sehen es immer noch nicht in seiner ganzen Größe. Lassen sie mich, meine Herren, meine politischen Ausführungen schließen, mit einem dringenden Appell, nochmaligen Appell, an die Sowjetunion: es liegt allein in der Hand der Sowjetunion den Frieden in der Welt herbeizuführen. Sie braucht nur der vorgeschlagenen kontrollierten atomaren Abrüstung zuzustimmen, dann kann sich die ganze Welt, dem Wirken des Friedens zuwenden.","This NATO ministerial conference is taking place at a time that is shaped by threatening notes and declarations by the Soviet Union to several partners of the Atlantic alliance. You know that the decision we made two years ago to join NATO has found and is still being criticized, especially on the other side of the Iron Curtain. The federal government and the majority of parliament stand by this decision as ever. I want to briefly explain the reasons for this. The leading statesmen of Soviet Russia advise at every opportunity to start from realities. Now let's take a look at the realities of our time. It is an all too real fact that the Soviet Union has kept around 5 million soldiers under arms since 1945 with only minor fluctuations, that in particular 22 divisions are in the Soviet-occupied zone of Germany. Divisions that now have around 7,500 modern tanks at their disposal, almost three and a half thousand more than two years ago. I can only see a constant, latent threat in this and I am convinced that any responsible statesman at any other time would also have seen such a huge force in his neighboring country as a threatening reality for his country. To the numbers just mentioned, I can add impressive figures about the Soviet air force, submarine fleet or the Soviet atomic bomb potential and in maintaining such a force, gentlemen, I see a very serious reality. The second reality of our time is that the Soviet leaders have not given up faith in their mission, which is to make the whole world communist. You have meanwhile repeated this in many speeches and the works of Lenin are still being taught in the Soviet Union, who said: ""If the proletariat wages a war to strengthen or expand communism, then such a war is justified and a holy war"". And elsewhere: ""We Marxists have always been and are always in favor of a revolutionary war against the counter-revolutionary peoples"". We only need to look in the atlas and the history book, where were the borders of the Soviet Union in 39, and where are they today. In 40, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania fell, and the attack on Finland failed. At the end of the war, the Soviet Union, which used to brand any territorial gain as imperialism, annexed parts of Finland, Poland, Romania, Czechoslovakia and East Prussia. The Soviet Union advanced further and further west. Wherever there were Soviet troops, communist governments were formed. In Poland, Romania, Bulgaria, Albania, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, the Soviet occupation zone of Germany. Gentlemen, that is the third reality. NATO's firm stance convinced the Soviet Union that any further advance would lead to military countermeasures by the Atlantic alliance. The Federal Republic of Germany joined the North Atlantic Pact two years ago. We took on the task of setting up our own armed forces to protect our territory and the West because we take it for granted that the Federal Republic, as a sovereign state, must contribute its own troops to the common defense of its territory and the West. The federal government, gentlemen, has the will to do its full contribution, we must strengthen our security and avert the apocalyptic fate of a modern war. We all know that a modern nuclear war would be an apocalyptic disaster, not only for the population of the Federal Republic and the West, but for all of humanity, including the peoples of the Soviet bloc. We observe with growing concern the attitude of the Soviet government towards the gravest problem that history has confronted our generation. I fear the leaders of the Soviet Union still do not see it in all its greatness. Let me, gentlemen, close my political remarks with an urgent appeal, renewed appeal, to the Soviet Union: it is in the hands of the Soviet Union alone to bring about peace in the world. It only needs to agree to the proposed controlled nuclear disarmament and the whole world can turn to the work of peace."

The TEMPORARY PRESIDENT: We begin this thirteenth session of our Assembly only a few weeks after we have met in emergency special session to consider the renewal of crisis in the Middle East. 4. May I here, at the outset of this Assembly. reiterate the hope I expressed when we ended the emergency sesston; may deedsflowfrom the resolution adopted by the General Assembly on 21 August 1958 [!!solution 1237 (ES-III)], deeds which help to make the principles of the United Nations more effective in the Middle F:ast. It is not so much in what they say, important as woms are, but in what they do, that the Members of this Organization will prove that they adhere to their Charter undertakings. 5. The nations of the Middle East which have been most closely concerned with the crisis there, and which are primarily to be looked to for its removal, played a decisive, role in our recent'deliberations in enabling the Assembly to arrive at a unanimous recommendation. By this action, they emphasizedtheir commitment to observe the injunction that States should ""p:""3.ctise tolerance and live together in peace with one another as good neighbours"". By this joint action they also enhanced the ability ofourOrganization to encourage peaceful processes of reconciliation. The solution which is now being sought, with the disintereste~assistance of our Secretary-General, is a United N!'u'ons solution. A1~ of us-not merely the Middle East countries, or the major Powers, but aU the Governments represented in this Assembly:-therefore have an obligation to contribute to that solution. 6. Events since the twelfth session serve to emphasize the iact that we live in an irrevocably·interdependent world. They serve to remind us, also, tJiat the imperatives of that interdependence, both within regional societies and in broader spheres of intergovernmental contact, have, unhappily, not been fully heeded. In a time of rapid change it would, of course, be pointless to expect that there should be no serious cleavages of opinion, and no conflicts of aim and policy. But when we rememberthe manlfold opportunities offered, within this Organizationand through other means, for the peaceful negotiation of disputes, we ought not to resign 'Qul'selves passively' to the belief that changes can occur only to the accompaniment of violence, antagonism, and disorder. 7. It is. the supreme task of this Organt.....r~n-a task which it has yet to fulfil-to see to it that,;ransitions in human affairs in any pari of the world are not determined by force, that security in one half of the world is not founded on attempts to deny security to the rest of the WOrld, and that peacemeans more than the absence of war. If the United Nations is to make 
Its full impact on the problems which confront it, its Members must make 4 mor resolute offort to adjust their national policies to the larger objectives of the Charter. The measure of that effort will decide the future of the Organization and of peace among nations. A principal aim must still be to make easier the evolution of peoples towards Increased freedom in conditions of grenter safety. 8. It can, I think, properly be clalmod that despite its many other préoccupations the United Nations has not allowed the evänts of recent months, or tha continuing difficulties in great Powor relations, to obscure its obligations to holp the less developed countries in their struggla to win bottor standards of He for their people. During the last decade we have boon fortunate to witness the emergünce of vigorous new sovereigntios in Asla, the Middle East, and Africa, Thoro are fow, if any, of these nations which are not labouring devotedly to break the vicious circle of poverty, 11Hterity and disease in which their people for 
too long have been bound. 9. During the past year, the momentum of the Organization's economic and social activities has not Blackened; important new beginnings have been made, and the foundations laid for further progress. The Second United Nations Intemational Conference on the Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy has been meeting In Geneva, It can confidently be predicted that its work will hasten the day when the benefits of this vast new power will be extended throughout the globe. 10. From all this we can, I believe, derive consid erable encouragement. The results of United Nations activities, as well as of numerous multilateral und bilateral programmes, have been of immense benofit In Supplementing national endeavours. They have brought greater hope to millions, pushing back the frontiers of want and misery and building confidence where none oxdsted bofore. But they mark only the beginning and great needs remain unsatisfied In countries which have ahown a capacity for sound planning, progressive social attitudes and 1 con centrated domestic effort.

11. It is indisputably true that poverty anywhere menaces prosperity everywhere. But it is also Indisputably true that the disparity between the advanced and the less developed countries is growing. Surely it is nothing less than tragic that, while this should be so, the richest Powers on earth should expend their wealth and stretch their nerves in mutual fear and hostility-and this at a time when man's Increasing mastery of his physical environment has put him in reach of und reamed of plenty. 12. Let us hope that the discussions to be held at this thirteenth Session of the General Assembly on one of the most dramatic of mankind's technological triumphe-I refer to the exploration of outer space will clear the way for an early accord that outer space will be used solely for peaceful and scientific purposes. Our opportunities have been made immeasurably large; our responsibilities have grown in like measure, 13. In the critically important field of disarmament, It will be recalled that the Assembly ended its twelfth session in a state of deadlock, deprived of agreement elther on what prctical steps should be taken to check the 21m9 nace, or on the forum in which a solution should be sought. In view of this deeply 
diequieting fact, it is especially encoumging that the Genoval talks on the technical aupacts of Suspension of wompons tests should have been brought to i successful conclusion. It will be a world-wido hopa that the negotiations to be pursued in Geneva at the end of October 1958 will bring an Oqually successful result, 14. The central problem of disarmament, however, brooks no delay. It is, I bellove, urgint that thora should be Toyumption and Intonsification of tho affort to reduce the burden of Armament and of foar weighing so heavily on the world. 15. Members of the Assembly, I shall not detain you longor. May I In conclusion, say that it has beon a Very great privilege and honour to have been associated with you in tho Ercat United Nations enterprigo and to have been ablo, with the wise advice of MT.

The PRESIDENT: Now that the Assembly. has received and considered the report ofthe FourthCom.. mittee and. has taken dectsions on the question qfthe future of,the Tl'ustTerritories of the Cameroons, the work of the thirteenth session ofthe GeneralAssembly has been completed. 226. Before I close the session formally, I wish to congratulate the General Assembly on its historic decisions with respect to the Cameroons, and I wish to express my beat wishes to the peoples and Governments of the Cam.eroons for a steady and prosperous growth in tho life of freedom and responsibility. 227. At the end of the fil'stpart ofthe session, exactly three months ago, I called thissession ""the African session"". The second part, which we are concluding now"" confirms andenhancesthis appellation,for during the thirteenth session of the General AssemblyAfrica played a very' important role-in fact, it played the leading role. It didso,first, interms of the substantive subjects discussed and voted on, among which,representatives will recall, were the questions of South Africa, Algeria, and the welcomingof Guinea into the membership of the United Nations, and, in thepresent resumed part, the question of the future of the Cameroons, It has also played a role in terms of the active part undertaken by the African States themselves in our deliberations. Not only was Africa, therefore, the subject of our consideration, but the Afrioan peoples, through their representatives here, spoke more vigorously and more eloquentl.v perhaps thanever before. 228. Africa, then, is coming into its own, and the Uliited Nations is playing a constructive role in this process. Through the orderly processes of the United Nations, this Organization is helping significantly in the emergence of the peoples of Africa intoa status of dignity, freedom and independence. 229. Three months ago, just as we were adjourning until this resumed part of the session, I expressed my personal appreciation of the co-operation which I was honoured to receive during this thirteenth session of the General Assembly from my colleagues onthe General Committee, the Vice-Presidents, and the Chairmen of the seven standingCommittees ofthe AEsembly, from the whole membership of the eighty-two nations represented here, and from the Secretary-General and his colleagues and assistants inthe Secretariat. Ishall now reiterate my profound gratitude for this massive co-operation whichI received from ever~' side. 230. The United Nations is llkelytoplayinthe future, a very important and perhaps even a decisive role in the critical and difficult days ahead,for itappears that the world still has before it most trying days. Guided by the Charter and its lofty principles, and by the dedication of all our membership to the cause of peace and justice, I am confident that the United Nations, in the crucial trials ahead, will live up to mankind's expectations of it. It is my profound conviction that only the spirit oftruth, justice, andthe deepest respect for what essentially belongs to man, is going to save the world from war, or from a fate even worse than war. I pray that the nations and their leaders may be inspired by this spiriti andmylastwordbefore I close this session is to wish you all, and your peoples, the best and highest that you wish for yourselves."
10086,"Víctor Andrés Belaúnde, PGA Inauguration Speech",http://undocs.org/en/A/PV.864,Víctor Andrés Belaúnde,President of the General Assembly,Inauguration Speech,1959,,"3. The TEMPORARY PRESIDENT (translated from Spanish): The year since last September has been a test for our Organizatiop.. It began well with the unanimous election of a President, an election which I regarded as an honour conferred on my country and a symbol of a general desire to understand the grave prob16:m.j;l to be settled. Subsequently, the resolution 0;11 disarmam.ent [1378 (XIV) ],embodying the various drafts which had been submitted earlier, was also adopted unanimously. This recognized the interest of all peoples in participating in the Disarmament Commission and the principle of parity as. a means of balancing the interests of East and West. With the same unanimity, the Assembly reconstituted the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space [resolution 1472 A (XIV)}. 4. Eagerly but !""Gspectfully we heard statements by Mr. Khrushchev, Chairman of theCounnil ofMinisters of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics [799th meeting], Mr. L6pez Mateos, President of the United States of Mexico [828th meeting], Mr. Sekou Tour€l, President of the Republic of Guinea [837th meeting]. 5. The discussion of the Chinese aggTession in Tibet did not affect the general orientation of our discussions, and in this same spirit the Assembly settled the difiicUities in renewing the membership of the Security Council and the Trusteeship Council. 6. We were not specifically called upon to settle the great questions, but it was our duty to preserve the right atmosphere for their discussion. The world was already concerned about nuclear disarmament and the related problem of the control of outer space. The great Powers should have taken a decisive step.towards peace by embarking on a new and fair discussioL. of this question. The eyes of the world turned from our Assembly to the Summit Conference which was to be held in Paris. It is not for me, on leaving the Presidency, to comment on the collapse of that Conference or on the apparent or real reasons 'for it, for it is not the task of an outgoing President, and still less of the representative of a country outside the nuclear conflict, to intensify or aggravate the present disagreements. 7. The first result of this unfortunate collapse was a return to the atmosphere of the worst periods of international tension, and the struggle of ideologies and of vlords became evenmorebitter. The foundations of peace can only be laid in an an.uosp!1ere of mutual respect, understanding and the w:m l.,)X' E.greement.
Insults and ideological intransigence can destroy in a moment the result of long years of negotiation and adjustment, just as, when a deep crevasse appears in a Swiss glacier, the vibration or echo of a voice is enough to start an avalanche and cause a catastrophe. The failure of the Summit Conference has also had repercussions on problems in the American continent and on the growing crisis in the Congo. I am happy to express to the Security Council and the Secretary-General our appreciation of the way in which they have ()arried out the provisions of the Charter, always taking the most judicious steps. 8. A new use has been found for the institution of the emergency force, which leads us to hope that it \\'ill become a standing body within our Organization. 9. We must emphasize the importance ofthe Security . Council's resolution on the proper application of Article 52 of the Charter, which defines the relations between the world Organization and regional arrangements (If agenci~s. Th~se groupings, especially the first and foremost of them, the American system, must observe the principles of peace and security established by the United Nations. The American arrangemeut has everything necessary for the just, peaceful and effective solution of conflicts arising in our continent. The United Nations had to recognize that it was under a duty to call on regional organizations and to use all the resources which they fortunately possess. Regionalism is not a fixed rule, but a means of using the immediate relationship and effective link between neighbouring countries in order to place their problems in true perspective and thus isolate thE.m from the disturbing influence of outside interests or tendencies apparent j.n the struggle for power. 10. The Congo crisis has also beeu dealt with as a .regional matter. An appeal had to be made to the solidarity of the Mrican peoples, who were concerned to save the young Republic from political anarchy and economic! chaos. The Secretary-General deserves the thankS of all mankind for his decision, confirmed by the Security Council, to use forces from African countries and the co-operation of impartial European countries to keep order, to protect lives and to replace the forces of the former colonial Power. We can be proud of the manner in which the Security Coun~il hasrJ\.sen. to the high task entrusted to it by the Charter., The first thing to do in any conflict is to put it in the hands of an impartial body, which is free of any ambition for political or military domination and of all economic vested interests. This means discarding the old system of the balance of interests or of power of a minority of States, and replacing it by a new system which takesinto account, fir.st andforell1ost, the interests of the parties to the conflict and which uses the means' offered' by a commongeograpJ1y, history·'and culture, as well as the technical efficiency and moral authority of the United Nations.
11. Nothing colli:d have. given me more pleasure than presiding· oyer the fourth emergency sessiC\n of.the General Ansembly, at which we endorsed the wise resolutions 'of the Security Council and the vital work which the Secretary-General has carried out so efficiently. We can now hope that the Congo problem will soon be justly and peacefully .solved, under the authority of the Security COllDcil and the Assembly, in other words. under the authority of the highest international body in the world. I do not think I am being unduly optimistic when I say that our Organization has emerged from its recent difficulties strengthened and respected, with a reserve of moral force which it is in duty bound to use in dealing with the grave problems of the moment. 12. As outgoing President of the Assembly, and as Head of the delega.tion of Pe:ru for many years, I am vary pleased that sevente.en nl~W States are soon to be admitted to the family of thle United Nations. Ever since the Charter was signed at San Francisco, the Peruvian delegation has! wo-rked tirelessly to make the Organization universal. We can now saythat we have almost reached our aim. I once said that the nineteenth century was the age of the arrival of the new Latin American nations. I should like to add now that the twentieth century will be the ~ge of the arrival of the new independent nations of Asia and Africa. But there is a difference: When we gained our independence we were guided only by Bolivar's dream of establishing ODf~ day the unity and solidari1¥ of the new nations. Today, however, oursisternations in Africa and Asia have a true home in the great United Nations. 13. Today we have among us not onlym.anyMinisters of Foreign Mfairs, as on other occasions, but also distinguished Heads of State and Prime Ministers. Tltis is indeed an unparalleled occasion, which clearly shows how well we realize thatwe are on the threshold of events which will be critical for mankind. I should like to welcome all these distinguished representatives, and I thir.k I am expressing the will of the Assembly when I say that their presence here reflects a desire to use this Assembly in Qrder to restore harmony and good will and to make possible th~ solution of all urgent and fundamental problems by the -peaceful means set forth in the Charter of the United Nations. 14. Owing to the unavoidable circumstances of the last war, our Organization was built on two foundations: an d'hical and legalfoundatlon, implying the unselfish and impartial co-operation of all peoples united in the Assembly. and a political and coactive foundation, which required agreement among the great Powers. Unfortilnately, such agreement has constantly been prevented by crises, each of which has seemed worse than the last. But despite these disagreements, reflected in the vetoes in the SecurIty Council, our Oxganization has survived all the crises by constantly-I repeat, constantly-emphasizing the ethical and legal precepts. of the Charter, theaffirmation of which has always had the support of 'World public opinion. Our future depends on this ethical and legal element, and the world public opinion which gOf'JS with it, as expressedinthe Assembly, is exerting an eyer greater influence on the great Powers to afJhieve not only the negative objective of mere coexistence, but willing co-operation in a spirit of true understanding an1 solidilrity. 15. Peace is now the.supreme concern and aspiration , of ~ll m:.l.nkind. 'fhe day has passed when a military victory, even one bearing a new message for mankind, could compensate for the squandering of wealth and the bloody sacrifice 'of human lives. A lightning victory by· surprise .attack and the discovery of a weapon toeIld all weapons are now purely Utopian ideas.
16. Peace is not only an ethical ideal, but a vital need for mankind. We cannot allow mad obsessions, miscalculations or tragic emergencies to unleash the horrors of war and universal destruction.
17. It is an unfortunate fact of h~an history that economic and. political ·systems have nl~ver at any time been content to develop within their own frontiers. They have always tried to reach beyond them, and have set up or attempted to set up systems of world supremacy. The danger of this tendency, apart from its economic consequences, is that it wortunately involves politiccl demands on other peoples. In another age these tendencies might leadto partially destructive wars, with long intervening periods of recovery. But now that nuclear weapons have been discovered, the dangers have reachedsnchproportions that they are mathematically infinite and carry the seeds of their own tragic penalty of self-annihilation and the destruction of all others. 18. If we look at the nuclear problem from this point of view, we clearly caDIlot rely on the balance between the great Powers or on their judgement, which constantly changing circumstances often prove to be erroneous. Nuclear disarmament andthe control of outer space are problems w~ch·directly concern all men and are therefore matters manifestly within the competence of our Organization. 19. The problem of conventional arms can be settled in practice by a.n agreement on ceiling figures for the great Powers. 'i'ha regulation of the armaments of other States must be based not on political precodent, but on the objective faots of population, gceographical position, length of frontiers and the truo needs of legitimate national or continental defence. 2(1. The Assembly should devote all its efforts to nuclear disarmament. We can resolve· the false antithesis between control without disarmament and disarmament without control by following the idea outlined at the sixth session of the Assembly, that disarmament and control are indivisible and must be simultaneous. 21. It would be best if control withpropersafeguards were supervised by impartial·countries, which means the small Powers. Those who tool: part in the Disarmament Commission know well that nuclear disarmament is not now impeded by technical difficulties; the few that exist can be .solved. The obstacles to disarmament are t....Jay of an essentially political nature. Disarmament calls for the peacp.fu1 atmosphere, the pure air and the free spirit of the Assembly discussions. The specific measures can be left to the Ten-Nation Committee on Disarmament, on which East and West are equally represented. 22. The conflicte which are bound to arise in any .such body cC''' i, ':le solved by the timely, intelligent and . imparci.:.~ iatervention of the Assembly. The AsseD;J.bly would thus have twc tasks: to lay down the general conditions of disarmament agTeed upon by all Powers; and to resolve deadhcks in the Ten-NatiOn Committee. 23. I hope the great Powers can accept the Assembly'); arbitration. otherwise, the differenees would never be settled, and we would continue to be in the situation in which we have been for the last ten years. The fairestmeans ofsolvingtheseproblems is to seek the opinion of the Assembly, which represents the conscience mankind. We cannot allow mad obsessions, sents the conscience of mankind.
24. At moments such as this we must think not only of States, but of peoples. The Preamble of our Charter does not say ""the Governments or states"", but ""the peoples of the United Nations"". This does not mean that we should deny the importance of State or government representation but, at the historic moment when the San Francisco Charter was signed and welcomed by all manla.nd as a sign of new hope, the Assembly reflected and expressed the desires of all the peoples of the world. Now that the nuclear arms race, based on power politics, hinders the great Powers' plans for social reform and their God-given mission to help the less industrialized countries, we should return to that spirit of San Francisco.
25. It is not only a. matter of human survival. Human life must also be made fit for the human being, both from the material standpoint of health and nutrition and from the spiritual one of culture and. above all, freedom. 26. An unstable nuclear balance might bring about a negative and sterile coexistence for a while. We do not think, however, that this tragic dilemma is ineviiable, or that there can only be a temporary truCE) under the threat of total and immediate destruction. Let us work to create an atmosphere of understanding, involving the renunciation of all political domination, ideological supremacy and Utopian dogmatism, and leading to a clear acknowledgement of the fact that the principles ofthe Charter should govern the conduct of all States, great and small. 27•. Spinoza thought that all·men should overcome the limitations of time and act sub specie aeternitatis, ignoring the blood-stained myths of race, political <1.omination and ideological Utopias. Let us, for our part, approach every question from the point of view cf all mankind and always act sub specie humanitatis.

Kennedy,President (United States),Inauguration Speech,1961,,"Vice President Johnson, Mr. Speaker, Mr. Chief Justice, President Eisenhower, Vice President Nixon, President Truman, reverend clergy, fellow citizens, we observe today not a victory of party, but a celebration of freedom--symbolizing an end, as well as a beginning--signifying renewal, as well as change. For I have sworn before you and Almighty God the same solemn oath our forebears prescribed nearly a century and three quarters ago.

The world is very different now. For man holds in his mortal hands the power to abolish all forms of human poverty and all forms of human life. And yet the same revolutionary beliefs for which our forebears fought are still at issue around the globe--the belief that the rights of man come not from the generosity of the state, but from the hand of God.

We dare not forget today that we are the heirs of that first revolution. Let the word go forth from this time and place, to friend and foe alike, that the torch has been passed to a new generation of Americans--born in this century, tempered by war, disciplined by a hard and bitter peace, proud of our ancient heritage--and unwilling to witness or permit the slow undoing of those human rights to which this Nation has always been committed, and to which we are committed today at home and around the world.

Let every nation know, whether it wishes us well or ill, that we shall pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, support any friend, oppose any foe, in order to assure the survival and the success of liberty.

This much we pledge--and more.

To those old allies whose cultural and spiritual origins we share, we pledge the loyalty of faithful friends. United, there is little we cannot do in a host of cooperative ventures. Divided, there is little we can do--for we dare not meet a powerful challenge at odds and split asunder.

To those new States whom we welcome to the ranks of the free, we pledge our word that one form of colonial control shall not have passed away merely to be replaced by a far more iron tyranny. We shall not always expect to find them supporting our view. But we shall always hope to find them strongly supporting their own freedom--and to remember that, in the past, those who foolishly sought power by riding the back of the tiger ended up inside.

To those peoples in the huts and villages across the globe struggling to break the bonds of mass misery, we pledge our best efforts to help them help themselves, for whatever period is required--not because the Communists may be doing it, not because we seek their votes, but because it is right. If a free society cannot help the many who are poor, it cannot save the few who are rich.

To our sister republics south of our border, we offer a special pledge--to convert our good words into good deeds--in a new alliance for progress--to assist free men and free governments in casting off the chains of poverty. But this peaceful revolution of hope cannot become the prey of hostile powers. Let all our neighbors know that we shall join with them to oppose aggression or subversion anywhere in the Americas. And let every other power know that this Hemisphere intends to remain the master of its own house.

To that world assembly of sovereign states, the United Nations, our last best hope in an age where the instruments of war have far outpaced the instruments of peace, we renew our pledge of support--to prevent it from becoming merely a forum for invective--to strengthen its shield of the new and the weak--and to enlarge the area in which its writ may run.

Finally, to those nations who would make themselves our adversary, we offer not a pledge but a request: that both sides begin anew the quest for peace, before the dark powers of destruction unleashed by science engulf all humanity in planned or accidental self-destruction.

We dare not tempt them with weakness. For only when our arms are sufficient beyond doubt can we be certain beyond doubt that they will never be employed.

But neither can two great and powerful groups of nations take comfort from our present course--both sides overburdened by the cost of modern weapons, both rightly alarmed by the steady spread of the deadly atom, yet both racing to alter that uncertain balance of terror that stays the hand of mankind's final war.

So let us begin anew--remembering on both sides that civility is not a sign of weakness, and sincerity is always subject to proof. Let us never negotiate out of fear. But let us never fear to negotiate.

Let both sides explore what problems unite us instead of belaboring those problems which divide us.

Let both sides, for the first time, formulate serious and precise proposals for the inspection and control of arms--and bring the absolute power to destroy other nations under the absolute control of all nations.

Let both sides seek to invoke the wonders of science instead of its terrors. Together let us explore the stars, conquer the deserts, eradicate disease, tap the ocean depths, and encourage the arts and commerce.

Let both sides unite to heed in all corners of the earth the command of Isaiah--to ""undo the heavy burdens ... and to let the oppressed go free.""

And if a beachhead of cooperation may push back the jungle of suspicion, let both sides join in creating a new endeavor, not a new balance of power, but a new world of law, where the strong are just and the weak secure and the peace preserved.

All this will not be finished in the first 100 days. Nor will it be finished in the first 1,000 days, nor in the life of this Administration, nor even perhaps in our lifetime on this planet. But let us begin.

In your hands, my fellow citizens, more than in mine, will rest the final success or failure of our course. Since this country was founded, each generation of Americans has been summoned to give testimony to its national loyalty. The graves of young Americans who answered the call to service surround the globe.

Now the trumpet summons us again--not as a call to bear arms, though arms we need; not as a call to battle, though embattled we are--but a call to bear the burden of a long twilight struggle, year in and year out, ""rejoicing in hope, patient in tribulation""--a struggle against the common enemies of man: tyranny, poverty, disease, and war itself.

Can we forge against these enemies a grand and global alliance, North and South, East and West, that can assure a more fruitful life for all mankind? Will you join in that historic effort?

In the long history of the world, only a few generations have been granted the role of defending freedom in its hour of maximum danger. I do not shrink from this responsibility--I welcome it. I do not believe that any of us would exchange places with any other people or any other generation. The energy, the faith, the devotion which we bring to this endeavor will light our country and all who serve it--and the glow from that fire can truly light the world.

And so, my fellow Americans: ask not what your country can do for you--ask what you can do for your country.

My fellow citizens of the world: ask not what America will do for you, but what together we can do for the freedom of man.

Finally, whether you are citizens of America or citizens of the world, ask of us the same high standards of strength and sacrifice which we ask of you. With a good conscience our only sure reward, with history the final judge of our deeds, let us go forth to lead the land we love, asking His blessing and His help, but knowing that here on earth God's work must truly be our own."

The PRESIDENT (translated from French): Mr.: Secretary-General, it is for me a great honour, and a great pleasure to be the first to congratulate you most warmly on the confidence that the General Assembly has just placed in you in appointing you to the high office of Acting Secretary-General of the United Nations. 
23. The important functions defined by the Charter which are now entrusted to you carry with them heavy responsibilities. I have every confidence that you will be able to perform those functions with courage, probity and complete impartiality, divesting yourself of your personal tasks in order to devote yourself exclusively, as senior international civil servant, to the great work of-the United Nations, and that you will worthily fill the great. vacuum left by your lamented predecessor, with all the authority with which the Charter invests your high office. It is my hope that in this you will be able to count on thecaoperation of all Members of the United Nations.
24. I now invite His Excellency U Thant to make his first statement as Acting Secretary-General of the United Nations.
25. The ACTING SECRETARY-GENERAL: Speaking for the first time in this hall, not in my familiar role as the representative of Burma but in the new role of Acting Secretary-General of: the United Nations, my first thought is to thank '!Y'~ fello\y representatives for the honour they have done me and the confidence that they have placed in me in electing me to this high office. May I at the same time thank the President for his very gracious words ofwelcome, and also the President and members of the Security Council for unanimously recommending my name to the General Assembly for election as Acting SecretaryGeneral.
26. Most of my colleagues present in this hall know me personally. They knowthat I come from a relatively small country in Asia. They know also that my country has steadfastly pursued over the years a policy of non-alignment and friendship for all other nations, whatever their ideologies. In my new role I shall continue to maintain this attitude of objectivity and to pursue the ideal of universal friendship.
27. Having been the Permanent Representative of my . country to the United Nations for the last four years and more, I am not unaware of the heavy responsibilities I am undertaking today. The debates in the General Assembly have already shown that the international climate can hardly be described as sunny. The Organization is also facing a serious financial problem. In the Congo operation, which is one of the major undertakings in the history of the Organization, we continue to encounter serious difficulties which clamour for an urgent solution.
28. If I am to discharge these responsibilities, surmount these difficulties and resolve these problems I shall need, in the first instance, the whole-hearted support, friendly understanding and unstinting cooperation of all my colleagues. I have enjoyed such friendly co-operation from you all for so long as a representative that I would fain hope that in my new role I shall receive it in even greater measure. For my part I shall endeavour to co-operate with you all in every possible way. In addition to- your cooperation I shall need also the loyal support of my colleagues in the Secretariat.
29. I know how hard the Secretariat has had to work during the last sixteen months, especially in connexion with the Congo operation. The Secretariat has shown itself capable 0"" meeting all demands made on it so far, and I count on the continued assistance and team spirit of my colleagues in the Secretariat, especially in the difficult days ahead that we shall face together. 30. In particular it i~ my intention to invite a limited number of persons who are at present Under-Secretaries, or to be appointed as Under-Secretaries, to act as my principal adviser's on important questions pertaining to the performance of functions entrusted to the Secretary-General by the United Nations .Charter. In extending this invitation I am fully conscious of the paramount consideration ofsecuring the higheststandards of efficiency, competence and integrity, and with due regard to the Importance of as wide a geographical basis as possible, as laid down in Article 101 of the Charter. I intend to include among these advisers Mr. Ralph J. Bunche arid Mr. Gregory Petrovich Arkadev. It is also my intention to work together with these colleagues in close collaboration and consultation in a spirit of mutual understanding. I am sure that they will seek to work with me in the same manner.
Of course, this whole arrangement is without prejudice to such future organizational changes as experience may reveal to be necessary.
31. Once again I thank the President, my fellow representatives in this hall, and the President and members of the Security Council for entrusting me. with these heavy responsibilities. In discharging these responsibilities I shall count on the support of all men and women of goodwill all over the world, whose overriding interest in the peace, security and progress of the world it will be my task to reflect and serve. The PRESIDENT (translatedfrom French): Ithank the Acting Secretary-General for the importantstate.... ment he has just made to the General Assembly and I venture to express the hope that the fulfilment of his declared intentions will facilitate the successful performance of the important functions vested in the Secretary-General by-the Charter ofthe United Nations. Now, I have a long list ofspeakers who have asked for the floor in orderto congratulate theActing SecretaryGeneral. I shall begin by calling on a number of them, in the hope that others will refrain from speaking, so that this meeting may be brought to a close. 33. Mr. STEVENSON (United States of America):. First, let me thank the Secretary-General for the important and comprehensive statementwhtehwe have just heard. Only last week we celebrated the sixteenth anniversary of the United Nations. It is fitting that we should begin the seventeenth year by putting our house in order with the election of our distinguished colleague, His Excellency U'Thant, to the high office of SecretaryGeneral. 34. There is much, it seems to us, to be thankful for here today. First of all, we may rejoice that there was available to' us a diplomat of such character, such ability and experience, that he could command the unanimous esteem and confidence of the world Organization. That augurs well for the future. The esteerr in which he is held has been earned by a lifetime o. public service both at home and abroad. We at the United Nations know at fir~t hand the many contributions that he has made to this institution. We have worked with him in his capacity as PermanentRepresentative of Burma. We know ofhis notable contribution to the work of the United Nations Conciliation Commission in the Congo. We know of the great regard in which he was held by the late Secret(',.l'y""""General, Mr. Hammarskjold, and we are also aware of his stature as educator, scholar and author. some of you may not know that almost thirty yearsago, when our colleague was a young man of twenty-three, he wrote . a book about the League of Nations. Even then he understood this century's profound need for a world organization to keep the peace, and this understanding has grown in him with the years. 35. I must confess that I have sometimes been discouraged during the long weeks of discussion that have preceded today's election. But as we say, all is well that ends well. And this prolonged ordeal has ended brilli~ntly. Moreover, during these weeks we have often been impressed anew by Ambassador U Thant's Independence of mind and spirit, his high intelligence, his energy and idealism, and that becoming modesty which is characteristic of his countrymen and of his co-religionists. We have much to be thankful for today, not only because of the individual who has just been appointed, but equally because of the propitious circumstances in which the General Assembly has appointed him. 36. The sole objective of the United States delegation, which has carried much of the burden of negotiation, has been to protect the integrity of the Charter and the office of the Secretary-General. That has been the purpose of many others who want to see this Organization grow in strength and influence, and that has been accomplished. There will be no veto in the Secretariat and no weakening of the office. The principles contained in Articles 100 and 101 of the Charter have been fully preserved. Hewill have the full power-s and responsibilities of that exalted office. He W.l.J.l appoint his own staff and consult with them as he decides, as he has told us, and in a manner consistent with the Charter. 37., When I, say, in passing, that I think there is a valuable lesson in the events that led up to today's action, I have in mind t'lat the quiet path of diplomacy often requires endless patience and perseverance, especially when it encounters the seemingly insurmountable obstacles. As I say, there have been many discouraging moments in our long negotiation. There have been other such moments in the history of the United Nations, and they too have been overcome. 38. My own conviction is' that we should always act in the belief that for those who are truly faithful to their ideals, the darkest hour is the time to light the brightest light. Recently I saw in our Press an item about a scientist who was on the brink of an important breakthrough, and when he described his experiments to a gathering of fellow specialists, the newspaper said, a wave of guarded enthusiasm swept through the audience. In the light '/of everything, I think that we representatives may be permitted a wave of unguarded. enthusiasm here today. I am happy to report to you tbat the President of\ the United States is one of' those who shares our hopes here today•.1 have just received a telegram from President Kennedy which he . has asked me to read to you, andT am happy to do so: I f ' I ., .. ,_........... "" ...........~:·""4 sa· s .. -e ftt sador U Thant, please express my personal congratulations, and assure him on behalf of the people of the United States that as he begins one of the world's most difficult jobs, he has our confidence and also our prayers."" 39. Finally, in my own capacity as the United States representative to the United Nations, I should like to say that all of us of the United States Mission feel-that we owe a great debt of gratitude to those representatives who have worked so hard and so patiently to solve the problems created by the death of Mr. Hammarskjold. And to my dear friend and colleague, the new Secretanr-General, I should like to say just one more thing. 'It is written in the Bible that ""To whom - much is given, of him also much shall be reqUired."" There is little doubt that enormous tasks will be required of you, and there is even less doubt that you will fulfil them. God bles~ you. 40. Mr. ZOBIN (Union of Soviet Socialist Republics) (translated from Russian): The Soviet delegation is . gratified to note the unanimous decision ofthe General Assembly, adopted on the Security Councilrs recommendation, to appoint to the post of Acting SecretaryGeneral of the United Nations for the period up to 10 April 1963 Ambassador U Thant, an eminent statesman and public figure of that peace-loving and neutral Asian Statep the Union of Burma. 41. The delegations of the States represented in the General Assembly are aware that the decision to appoint Ambassador U Thant is the result of numerous consultations between the various delegations. 42. The Soviet delegation, which in·the course of these consultations has invariably striven to secure the achievement of an agreement acceptable to all the parties concerned, is sincerely glad thatsU(,1h an agreement has now been reached. 43. 'The Soviet Union's position on the subject of the directing of the principal executive organ ofthe United Nations-the Sec:..~tariat-wasclearly and exhaustively expounded by the Chairman of the Council ofMinisters' of the USSR, Nikita Sergeevich Khrushchev, at the fifteenth session of the General Assembly [869th meeting] and oy Foreign Minister Gromyko at thepresent session [1016th meeting]. We are firmly convinced that thiE' position, based as it is on the profound changes which have recently taken place in the international situation and in the correlation of world forces, provides for an e':;~litable solution of the p:<.'oblem of the direction of ~;he United Nations Secretariat en a permanent basis, 44. In view, however, ofthe necessity oftaking speedier action here and now to ensure that the work of the Secretariat is effectively directed, the SovietUnion has agreed to accept a temporary solution ofthis problem. , 45. We would like to. point ,put in this connexion that the provisional·character of this solution does not mak~ the task ,ofAmbassador.UThant as Acting Secretary-General of tp.e Unite~ 'Nations either easier or less responsible. It will be his task to direct the executive organ of the United Nations over the whole field of those functions which, under the Charter, are vested in the chief administrative officer of the United Nations. 46. The Soviet delegation considers thatAmbassador U Thant, whose intelligence, ability and political experience are well known, will succeed in coping successfully with the serious tasks that lie ahead of him."

Along the sector border barbed-wire entanglements have been put up, large units of the People’s Police and border police have taken up position on the sector border in order to block all traffic between East and West Berlin. At the same time troops of the National People’s Army have been installed in East Berlin. These measures to obstruct traffic were effected in accordance with a decision taken on 12th August by the rulers of the Soviet-occupied zone of Germany. In executing that decision the Ulbricht régime clearly and unmistakably announced to the whole world the political bankruptcy of its 16-year-old despotism. These measures constitute the Ulbricht régime’s admission of the fact that it is not supported by the free will of the German people living in that zone. By these measures the Ulbricht régime confirms that the exercise of the right of self-determination by the German people should no longer be delayed for the sake of maintaining world peace. These illegal measures – which the Federal Government notes with dismay and disgust – are a flagrant violation of the four-power agreements on freedom of movement within Greater Berlin and of the fourpower agreements for the regulation of traffic between Berlin and the Soviet-occupied zone of Germany. By blocking traffic between East and West Berlin the régime in the Soviet-occupied zone of Germany has unilaterally and with brutal force violated the existing four-power agreements regarding Berlin recognised to this day by the USSR. The Federal Government notes with deep regret that this reckless act has been carried out with the consent of the Government of the USSR as the leading power in the Warsaw Pact. In giving its consent the Soviet Government has contradicted its own constant assertions about wanting to solve the problem of Germany and Berlin by means of negotiations. Whilst the American President at his last press conference on 10th August expressed anew the readiness of the United States Government to negotiate on the problem of Germany and Berlin, the rulers of the Soviet-occupied zone of Germany have reacted to the West’s desire for peace and negotiation by taking military measures. This reaction demonstrates, more strikingly than any words possibly could, to the whole world that the present crisis has been touched off alone by the German and Berlin policy pursued by the Soviets. It was the Government of the Soviet Union which, through its statements on 10th November 1958, initiated the Berlin crisis. In the meantime that Government has pointed out in countless notes and statements that irrespective of its other aims it did not contemplate infringing upon the freedom of West Berlin but would, on the contrary, solemnly guarantee that freedom. How can these statements be reconciled with the events of the last few days? The agreements of the Soviet Union with the three western powers were torn up, and the tanks of the People’s Army, the People’s Police and the Factory Combat Groups which have been concentrated in and around East Berlin in order to give military support to that illegal attack on the status of the City of Berlin, offer a foreboding of what would be the nature of the guarantee to be given to a so-called free city. On 13th August 1961, the world was witness to the first step along the way to the realisation of the stated aims. The four-power statute of the City of Berlin, valid under international law, has been broken once more. That latest measure is at the same time the gravest and most brutal. The barricades set up within Berlin and between Berlin and the Soviet-occupied zone by the zonal authorities at the behest of their masters are obviously meant to foreshadow the cutting-off of the free part of the German capital from the free world. In its decision of 12th August the puppet régime in the Soviet-occupied zone of Germany makes the futile attempt to motivate the alleged necessity of blocking all freedom of movement. It is beneath the dignity of the Federal Government to refute these distortions and false assertions in detail. They are gainsaid by reality itself. The Federal Government wants, however, to state emphatically that by this illegal action the rulers of the Soviet-occupied zone of Germany have shown to the whole world once and for all in which part of Germany militarism and aggression are practised. In its very latest note of 3rd August 1961, the Soviet Union – in renewing its demand for the conclusion of a so-called peace treaty and for the transformation of the valid four-power status of the City of Berlin, or rather of West Berlin only, into a so-called free city – based that demand on the assertion that such measures were necessary to meet an alleged militarism and revanchism in the Federal Republic. The Soviet Government again attempted to create the impression that responsible quarters in the Federal Republic intended to prepare for aggressive action against the Soviet Union or against some other State in the world. Anyone who comes to the Federal Republic can convince himself of the opposite, and the overwhelming majority of all the States throughout the world agree with us in the estimation of our peaceful policy directed exclusively to the defence of our vital interests. Anyone who today goes into East Berlin or the Soviet-occupied zone of Germany can see for himself that measures have been taken there which in the true sense of the word deserve to be termed military and revanchist. These measures have, moreover, been applied at a time when the whole world is filled with the one hope that there may not be any warlike conflict. In such a situation, grave enough in itself, the rulers of the Soviet-occupied zone, through military preparations, are playing dangerously with fire. The Federal Government considers it essential to draw the attention of world public opinion to the true causes of that policy of force. It is not any militaristic and revanchist policies by the Federal Government, as alleged, that have caused the rulers of the Soviet zone of Germany to disclose their true intentions. Their action is the result of their refusal to let the people in the Soviet-occupied zone of Germany live according to the way of life which they desire. It is both macabre and grotesque when the spokesmen of the Ulbricht régime stand up and declare that the Germans in the Soviet-occupied zone have already exercised their right of self-determination. The permanent flow of refugees in recent weeks tells a different story – i.e. the true story. It is instructive to recall at what juncture the tide of refugees began to rise again. That was when the heavy threats by the Soviet Premier to conclude a peace treaty with the Soviet-occupied zone of Germany brought home to the people living there the hopelessness of their situation. For these people, the announcement of a treaty of separation was a nightmare from which they wanted to escape under any circumstances. In their desperation they saw no other way out than to leave their homes in the Sovietoccupied zone, abandoning their possessions and risking their lives, in order to begin a new life in freedom and start all over again in the Federal Republic. Their free decision to renounce their homeland was the only way in which they could practise what remained of their right to self-determination. There was nothing left for them but to “vote with their feet”. By that vote these people have shown the world what they really want: they want freedom, not bondage. Reliable documentation in the hands of the Federal Government shows that, despite sixteen years of a reign of terror by Communist functionaries in the Soviet-occupied zone of Germany, over 90 % of the Germans living there reject the régime which oppresses them, despise the slave state forcibly imposed on them, and wish for nothing more ardently than to be united with the Germans who live in freedom. The Soviet Union keeps asserting that the present valid status of the City of Berlin is one of the causes of existing tensions. It is really not necessary to reiterate that that assertion is incorrect. But it is certainly indicated to point out emphatically that solving the problem of Germany on the basis of self-determination would be the best if not the only way to eliminate tensions and difficulties. Such a solution would indeed be a genuine contribution towards maintaining and securing peace in the world. In this grave situation, created by the lawless action of the rulers of the Soviet-occupied zone of Germany, the Federal Government keeps most closely in touch with its three western allies. Together with them it will prepare the necessary measures. 
The Federal Government and its allies concur in their appraisal of the dangers threatening the free world. For Foreign Ministers of the three western powers and of the Federal Republic assembled for consultation in Paris two weeks ago. I can state with particular satisfaction that those consultations were held in a spirit of full mutual agreement. They were supplemented and confirmed by a detailed consultation between the four powers and all the other members of NATO. Thus it has been possible to achieve full agreement on the basic western attitude, not only between ourselves and the western powers immediately concerned in the settlement of the German question, but also between all the NATO partners. After his discussions with the Foreign Ministers of France, Great Britain and the Federal Republic, the United States Secretary of State, Dean Rusk, informed the NATO Council who on this occasion again and unequivocally gave expression to the determination of all NATO countries to maintain the freedom of Berlin. At the same time the NATO Council reiterated its conviction that a peaceful and equitable solution to the problem of Germany, including Berlin, could only be achieved on the basis of the whole German nation’s right to self-determination. We shall continue these contacts in the coming weeks and months and shall, in closest agreement with each other, jointly take such action as may be necessary to ward off any Soviet attempts at curtailing the freedom of Berlin. Whilst, however, the western powers and especially the Federal Government representing the free part of Germany have shown an almost infinite measure of patience in attempting to bring about a settlement of these problems, avoiding any step likely to strain or exacerbate the international situation any further, the Soviet Union considers that it can solve these problems by sanctioning illegal actions of the zonal rulers in a manner contrary to law and the requirements of political reason. In this situation, Europe and the North Atlantic Defence Alliance simply have to prepare for the measures that are necessary to maintain our security and freedom. The Federal Government has taken note with great satisfaction of the excellent statement made by President Kennedy to the American people on 25th July. The Federal Government fully concurs with this statement. It shares the view that the West must, by uniting its military strength, prepare for the challenge directed against it. We know, and the Soviet Union knows, that the total military potential of the West is superior to that of the Soviet Union. Hence the threats directed from time to time against one or other of the NATO partners by the Soviet Government to the effect that it would devastate their territory by atomic bombs, are dangerous, the Soviet Government must know that by any such blow it would touch off a counter-blow by which it would be annihilated. The Federal Republic of Germany, too, will have to take measures within the framework of the Atlantic Defence Organisation to strengthen its military preparedness in order to assist and complement the efforts made particularly by the United States but also to a considerable extent by the other NATO partners. At this moment, when the fate of Berlin, when our fate is at stake, it is a dictate of self-preservation for us to declare our solidarity with our western allies and jointly with them to undertake the efforts that are necessary to meet the danger threatening us. Yet we are far from seeing in military measures a solution to the crisis artificially engendered by the Soviet Union. The Federal Government is not convinced that the Soviet Premier wishes to touch off a war that would devastate his own country, too. In fact, the Federal Government believes that it is possible now as before to find a way out of the situation in which the world finds itself, by means of negotiation. It is ready to support any approach to negotiations between the four powers responsible for Berlin and Germany as a whole. The Federal Government thinks it indispensable, however, to point out that the unilateral action taken by the rulers of the Soviet zone of Germany with the consent of the Government of the USSR is a strain on the readiness to negotiate shown by the West. The Federal Government will nevertheless not abandon its hope that negotiations may soon be started that will enable the German problem and thus the Berlin question to be solved on the basis of the right of selfdetermination of nations. The principle that all nations should be given the right to determine their own national system is making headway irresistibly throughout the world. The Federal Government is confident that it will prove possible to put this principle into effect in the heart of Europe, too, where today the right of self-determination is still being denied to 16 million Germans. The Federal Government has repeatedly stated, and reiterates on this occasion, that it is prepared to co-operate in plans giving the Soviet Union security guarantees in the event of a reunification of Germany. The latest statement to this effect was made by me in this house on 17th June of this year. This intention of the Federal Government has not changed. The restoration of German unity would not only serve the cause of peace but also the well-considered security interests of the Soviet Union and would benefit all other nations. The three western allies, who pursuant to the four-power agreement have undertaken a special commitment with regard to Berlin and Germany, have addressed an emphatic protest and a serious warning to the Soviet Union. They have designated the measures taken as illegal and as an irresponsible unilateral violation of existing arrangements. They have rightly repudiated the dishonest assertion contained in the so-called recommendation of the Warsaw Pact States alleging that these measures are in the interests of the German people; and they have emphasised that that assertion is nothing but an interference with the internal affairs of the German people. What the German people think about those brutal measures could easily be found out. It would suffice to put this question to all Germans in the Federal Republic, in the Soviet-occupied zone and in the whole of Berlin. The answer would be a passionate condemnation by the overwhelming majority of the German people. The Federal Government has the right and the duty to speak for the entire German people, including those Germans who are condemned to silence by the despotic measures taken in the Soviet-occupied zone of Germany. The Federal Government appeals urgently to the Soviet Union at this critical moment to find its way back to a realistic manner of looking at things. It should be beneath the dignity of a great nation to protect creatures who are despised by their own fellow-citizens. The Soviet Government and the Soviet people should not lend themselves to co-operating in the conversion into a concentration camp of part of a large neighbouring country against the will of its inhabitants. It should be realised in Moscow that throughout the world all those who believe in the right of self-determination of nations as recognised in the United Nations Charter can only feel profound contempt for a régime that tramples this right of selfdetermination underfoot. A reformation of relations between the Soviet people and the German people is not possible along the lines pursued by the authorities of the Soviet zone of Germany. The Germans in that zone have come to hate and despise those who violate them in so inhuman a manner. And they must be having similar feelings towards those who support that system. The closing of the border is an unprecedented admission of bankruptcy. It shows that the people who are compelled to live in that part of Germany can be prevented only by the use of physical force from leaving that paradise of workers and farmers. There is but one possibility of placing relations between the Soviet and German peoples on a new foundation: the German people must be given back the right, denied to no people on earth, to form, through a free and uninfluenced expression of their will, a government which would then be truly entitled to speak, act and decide on behalf of the whole German nation. The Federal Government moreover appeals to the governments of all those nations throughout the world who have signed or accepted the United Nations Charter. The measures carried out or announced by the Soviet zone authorities are, in fact, a flagrant violation of that basic law which is meant to be just as valid for the interior order of all nations as it is for the relations between them. It is with deep emotion that the Federal Government is mindful of the personal fates of the many millions who have fallen victim to those inhuman measures. Nearly three and a half million people have in recent years fled the Soviet-occupied zone of Germany and the eastern sector of Berlin because no other possibility of living a life in freedom was left to them. Relinquishing their occupations and leaving behind their property, they also broke off personal ties with their families, relatives and friends. Now the door has been slammed in the face of countless people intending to take the same road. The Federal Government expresses the hope, and indeed the conviction, that at the beginning of the negotiations, which it too desires, those measures will be revoked. Nothing would be better suited to convince the German people that such negotiations would serve the maintenance of world peace and contribute to a durable reorganisation of relations between the nations. 
It is not enough to speak of peace; words to this effect should be followed by deeds to show that peace must exist not only between the nations but even more so and quite particularly within the nations. Every individual has a right to live in peace. Absence of freedom is the most horrid form of peacelessness. The Federal Government and with it all Germans in the Federal Republic of Germany feel in these days particularly close to the Germans in the Soviet-occupied zone. We are all aware of the obligation that we have explicitly taken upon us when adopting our Basic Law. We stated at the time that we acted also on behalf of those Germans to whom participation was denied. To the entire German people on both sides of the zonal border we addressed our appeal to complete in free self-determination the unity and freedom of Germany. Our fellow-citizens in the Soviet-occupied zone should even in these critical days not doubt for a moment that we shall never slacken in striving passionately for the attainment of this great objective. We are sure of the support of all free nations in the world, and we have no doubt that the legitimate national concern of the whole German people will find its fulfilment. The tenacious determination of all Germans in all parts of our country is a prerequisite to such success; no-one in the world should ever doubt the determination and steadfastness of the Germans in this vital problem of our people. Let me finally say a few words to the inhabitants of the eastern sector of Berlin and the Soviet zone of Germany. Your sorrow and suffering are our sorrow and suffering. In your particularly difficult situation you were able at least to derive some comfort from the thought that, if your lot should become quite unbearable, you could mend it by fleeing. Now it looks as if you have been deprived of this comfort, too. I request you with all my heart: do not abandon all hope of a better future for yourselves and your children. We are convinced that the free world, and particularly we here, will someday be successful in our efforts to obtain freedom for you. The right to self-determination will continue its victorious march throughout the world and will not halt at the boundary of the Soviet zone. Believe me, the day will come when you will be united with us in freedom. We do not stand alone in the world; justice is on our side, and so are all the nations who love freedom. "

I appreciate that the honour you have done me is a tribute to the country and to the people whom I have the honour to represent here. Pakistan is not a great Power, nor a country which, apart from its own security and the well-being of its people, has any ambition or interest other than the common interestof all of us here; that is to say, the creation of a world in which peace may reign and law prevail, so that through beneficent co-operation, the common man in all the regions of the earth might at long last be enabled to claim and possess his rightful inheritance of a fuller, richer and happier life. 12. Over the years, Pakistan has given proof of its loyalty to theCharter of the United Nations and of its sincere devotion to the spirit and purposesuflderlying the provisions of that Charter. By its conduct and policy Pakistan has clearly affirmed its faith in the right of all peoples and nations, indeed of all human beings, to freedom, dignity and a reasonable standard of well"";'being. These principles and ideals, as well as the yearning of hundreds of millions of my fellow beings around the globe to comprehend their effect upon their own lives, occupy the forefront of my mind as I begin to discharge the responsibilities of this high office. 13. The example setby my distinguishedpredecessor, Mr. Mongi Sl~m, will be a source ofinspiration for me. His many gifts and virtues can hardly be surpassed. I shall be content if I can, in some measure, emulate his. qualities.• of patience and courtesy and his great gift for clarity. We are fortUnate in that Mr. Slim has put· down on paper his thoughts on the organization andfunctioning of the Assembly. The suggestions made by him fO:rm the subject of a separate itenl on the agenda and I will not, at this stage, go into the merits of thesfil valuable and thought-provoking proposals. It is. however, generally recognized. that with the increase in the number of Members and in the number and importance of the items placed on the agenda. some thought must be given to ways of organizing the work of the annual sessions of the Assembly in such a .manner that, without ·108S of efficiency, it can be brought to a successful conclusion' expeditiously. In the meantime much can be done to make our ll'l.bours proceed more'smoothly by the voluntary exercise of diligence,' restraint and punctuality on the part of us -all: lam confident that lInay count upon the generosity· 'and' cO-dperation·of all Members of this Assembly to that end. 
14. I am fortified also in the knowledge t..lJ.at I shall have the benefit of the assistance and advice of the secretariat. headed by the secretary-General whose devotion to the Crganization and to the ideals and purposes of the Charter is established beyond doubt•. 15. The seventeenth session of the General Assembly. like its predecessor, has a long and difficult agenda before it. While this seasion opens in a more tranquil atmosphere than did the preceding session, it is confronted with many grave issues, some of a momentous nature for the futUI'e of marJdnd aB well as of this Organiza.tion. It is not :my purpose, nor would it be appropriate forme. to venture p.nv observations as to the substance of the items included in the agenda. I should like only to note with pleasure that the very first item ~rou will be called on to consider is the one relatingt·othe admission of new Member-s. The applications of four newMembers-Rwanda. Burundi. Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago-have already been approved by the Security Council. It is hoped that in the course of this session the ASsemhly will be able to welcome Uganda to its membership also. It is a matter of special gratification and joy that the travail of the brave and gallant people of Algeria is at an end and that we shall soon see them also take their rightful place in our midst. 16. With the admission of every new Member the map of the world changes a l:i.ttle and this Organization is one step nearer to the goal of becoming truly the tribune of mankind. The relationship between nations is undergoing a healthy change from orie of dominance and subservience to one of equality and co-operation. As a consequence, amity is now i1'1 the process of replacing strife and discord is yielding to beneficent co-operation. 17. There is a striving today among all peoples to live in freedom and in peace with each other. The agenda before you deals withissuesoffreedom,peace, progress and prosperity. I humbly beseech God to bestow upon us t'""'e wisdom, the understanding and the tolerance which would enable us so to order our work and shape our decisions that they might serve to abolish mankind's, ancient fears. to assuage its hurts and to forward the fulfilment of its eternal hopes. Amen.
Our final. prayer is: the worthiness of perfect praise belongs to Allah, the Lord of all the world.

10099,"Konrad Adenauer, Chancellor Inauguration Speech",https://www.jfklibrary.org/asset-viewer/archives/JFKPOF/041/JFKPOF-041-026,Konrad Adenauer,Chancellor (Germany),Inauguration Speech,1962,,"Toasts of the President and Chancellor Konrad Adenauer of the Federal Republic of Germany at a luncheon in the state dining room
The President: Chancellor, I want to express on behalf of all the members of the Government who are here and all Americans our very warm welcome to you, to the Foreign Minister, to the members of your Government, and to tell you how pleased we are that you are visiting us once again.
I think that the instinctive judgment of my predecessors and the members of their Government after the Second War in realizing how essential it was to the security of the West, of the Free World, that there should be a strong and independent Germany was matched by the instinctive judgment of the German people that their future lay in a free and expanding and growing Europe. This sense of the future which dominated the political thinking of both of our people and their leaders in those days I think will go down as one of the significant decisions in the history of the modern world.
It is our responsibility, Chancellor that decision having been made, to build upon it and to attempt to move from an increasingly strong and powerful Europe and Atlantic community to an increasingly strong and powerful free world. It seems to me that both the United States and the Federal Republic, and Europe, and indeed, the whole Atlantic partnership, have a great role to play in the maintenance of freedom all around the globe.
We are very proud to have you here, Chancellor, as one of the architects of this relationship. We had one in Mr. Acheson, who played a most significant role during those days. And those of us who have followed in this country want to assure you that we still regard the close and intimate ties between the Federal Republic and the United States as the strongest possible insurance for the defense of Europe, which is essential to the defense of the United States, and we still believe that this is the base from which those actions must spring which will provide a protection for our vital interests, and, if we are determined to be strong enough, the peace of the world. We welcome you here during a time of very great change in the world, both in the West and in the East. It will be our task, Chancellor, to make those judgments today which will serve the future as well as the judgments which were made in which you participated a decade or ore ago which have so served us at present.
Chancellor, we welcome you here at an important turning point, possibly, in the history of the relations between East and West, and in any case we welcome you as an old, valued and courageous friend. 
Ladies and gentlemen, I hope you will join with me in toasting to the Chancellor, to the members of his Government, to the German people, and the President of the Federal Republic.
Chancellor Adenauer: Mr. President, Gentlemen; When Germany collapsed in 1945, and I looked at the situation with which we were confronted at the time, I was wondering whether the real victor of this war, the United States of America, would meet the historical task which this event had placed on the shoulders of the United States. And, indeed, the United States of America at that time was aware of this task and met its historical obligation. I think in the history, especially in the history of modern times, it is very rare indeed that the victor helped the vanquished to raise again and to stand up again, and that I feel was the great historical deed performed by the United States of America after the last war. You supported the vanquished, especially us, the Germans, my people. You gave them possibility, offered them a chance to recover from the consequences of this terrible catastrophe. That is why we have these strong bonds, why we adhere to the same principles as the United States of America, and especially to the principle of liberty and freedom.
I feel you should try to imagine what it means for a vanquished nation after such a murderous fight and war to see the victor extend the helpful hand to the vanquished. It was not only the material aid and assistance, but it was, above all, the human attitude, the human aspect, the human spirit in which this was done which established these inseperable bonds between our two countries.
And if I look at the history of these last few years, and you must know I haven’t been very long in politics yet, only since 1945, and so my political memory is still very young and still very fresh because in this connection it is not age that counts but it is the years which you have spend in a political career – in looking back on these years I think of President Truman and Secretary Acheson, who were the first to take the moves, the initiatives, to establish the close relationships with Germany. I think of Secretary Dulles and President Eisenhower.
Let me take this opportunity to pay my greatest respects and express my deepest gratitude to these gentlemen.
I want, on this occasion in particular, to express my very warm and heartfelt thanks to President Kennedy and his associates for having taken up this tradition in a world which becomes more dangerous, more and more dangerous, from day to day, to take up the tradition which was established by President Truman, namely to maintain close relations with the German people.
I feel one can say that the German people have learned something from the past. Of course, the Germans have their faults, too. Who hasn’t any faults? But the Lord forgive some of these faults and some of these sings, and, therefore, I feel one should also forgive the Germans their old since, if they do not commit any new ones. But I am sure that the Germans have learned something from the past.
Now, of course, reading the press recently, I perhaps might not have been so pleasant. I am going to meet the National Press Club tomorrow, but I am not afraid that my meeting, my encounter, with the National Press Club will be as tough as some people are afraid it will be, or feel or fear it to be, because if you look at the German people I feel I am sure you will find out that them freedom and liberty. Of course, sometimes you may be mad and angry with the press. But, nevertheless, there is nobody who wants to touch upon freedom and liberty of the press.
I remember years ago when I was Lord Mayor of Cologne I once had a dinner with a German poet who died many years ago, Max Halbe, and in the conversation I explained to him that I was angry about a press article which had appeared on that day. He took the menu and wrote two lines in German which translated read “My Dear Friend, if you get angry about the press, do not worry. There will be a new edition tomorrow.” And that is what I have always thought of whenever I get angry at the press. I think of these two lines of Max Halbe.
Mr. President, in my political life, I have had a number of meetings and political discussions, and I never judged these meetings by the communique which is issued afterwards because in most cases the communique is put on the table right at the beginning of the negotiations, before they have even started. But I judged them by the contents of the conversation. In applying this criterion, Mr. President, I think I can say from the conversation and talks we have had this morning that this has been a good meeting and is going to be a good meeting, a very good meeting, which was urgently needed in this very critical situation in which we find ourselves today.
Let me also express my warmest congratulations to you, Mr. President, and to the American Nation for the very firm stand which you have taken in the Cuban question. I feel that this was a very great success for the United States of America, and it was a failure for Mr. Khrushchev. The world once again has seen Mr. Krushchev as he really is. 
I propose a toast to you, sir and to the American people."

Since we last met, two important developments have taken place: the conclusion of the treaty banning nuclear tests in the atmosphere, in outer space and under water, and the establishment of a direct telephone line between the capitals of the two great nuclear powers, The peoples of the world see i~ these developments an assurance that further steps are possible in developing mutual understanding, in resolving conflicts and in strengthening international peace and security, 5, It is not for me, as Temporary President, to discuss the work of the forthcoming session, but I hope that you will permit me to express my profound satisfaction at the advances which have been made and which hold out such promising prospects for the future. 6. In our time we are both witnesses of, and participants in, the gradual development of a world community of nations and of peoples. Throughout the world there is a deep sense of expectancy, a longing among all the peoples to live in peace and to strive together to achieve social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom. 7, As at the opening of the seventeenth session so today I pray humbly, sincerely, earnestly, that we may be rightly guided in our deliberations and be granted the courage, the strength, the vision necessary for supporting and advancing the cause of justice, peace, freedom and prosperity for all, As always: All praise be to Allah, the Lord of the Universe.
15. The PRESIDENT (translated from Spanish): On assuming the responsibilities of President of the eighteenth session of the General Assembly, I wish, first and foremost, to express to you my deep gratitude for the great honour you have conferred upon me in electing me to this high office. This is an honour bestowed primarily on my country, an honour which places upon me the obligation, as a son of the native land of Sim6n Bolfvar, to be guided in my activity by the noble ideals to which our Liberator dedicated his life. I pray that the Almighty will make me worthy of the confidence you have placed in me. I assure you that I shall do everything in my power to discharge creditably the great responsibility which I am assuming. 16. It is with trepidation that 1 follow in the footsteps of Presidents of such great stature as those who have preceded me in this office. The outstanding ability of my immediate predecessorI Sir Muhammad Zafrulla Khan, in particular, will be my source of inspiration. I shall do my utmost to emulate the qualities and competence of my predecessors. 17. I call upon you all to give me your generous and indispensable co-operation, as I am sure you will, to assist me in the efficient conduct of our proceedings. I also know that I can rely on the invaluable assistance and knowledge of the Secretariat under the distinguished leadership of the Secretary-General. This confidence in the help which I shall receive gives me the courage to face with optimism the difficult responsibilities you have placed upon me and leads me to hope that my efforts to serve you and the cause of the United Nations will not be in vain. 18. Venezuela, my native land, is not a great Power, but it is a young and dynamic country which, in its 152 years of independent existence and amid all the vicissitudes which have beset it, has constantly upheld the rule of law in its international relations. True to the traditional principles of all the peoples of America, principles which are also set forth in the United Nations Charter, such as the obligation to seek a solution of international disputes by peaceful means, the principle of self-determination of peoples and the principle of the equality of all men without distinction as to race, colour, nationality or religion, Venezuela has steadfastly maintained its faith in the United Nations and has always striven, both within and outside the Organization, to further the implementation of each and everyone of the lofty ideals set forth in the Charter. For all its imperfections -imperfections which are inherent in it as an institution shaped by human hands-the United Nations is today an indispensable need of mankind. 19. It is a charactertstic fact of the present century that the astounding achievements of science and technology have not gone hand in hand with similar progress in the disciplines applicable to human relations. The importance of the spiritual values has too often been forgotten, and too much reliance has been placed on purely material progress. The United Nations Charter represents a great effort to redress this imbalance, and if its principles are applied without overlooking the spir-Itual content embodied in them, great advances will be made towards that better world desired by all men and all nations. 20. Since the Second World War three political imperatives have emerged with irresistible force and are shaping the course of history in this second half of the twentieth century. These are: the outlawing of war as a means of settling international disputes, the abolition of the dependence of certain peoples on others, and international co-operation with a view to improving the levels of living of the developing peoples. 21. The conviction that, given the existing means of destruction, total war is inconceivable since it would mean the extermination of the human race; the conviction that if men and nations are to live in peace there must be equality of rights and mutual respect between them; and the conviction that if peace is to be secured a further necessity is the gradual abolition of the profound imbalance between the highly industrialized nations, whose people are enjoying growing prosperity, and the under-developed countries, the masses of whose peoples are languishing in poverty and ignorance-these three convictions have directed international activity towards a triple objective: peaceful coexistence, with its logical corollary, general and complete disarmament under effective international control; the wiping of colonialism and racial discrimination from the face of the earth; and international co-operation designed to help the developing countries to achieve economic stability. The United Nations has made incontestable progress in prosecuting these ends; but the work which remains for it to do is of much greater dimensions. 22. The recently concluded Moscow Treaty banning nuclear tests,.!! which does credit to and greatly enhances the prestige of the Signatory States, the successive appearance of new independent States, the technical asststance being provided to the developing countries and the holding of the forthcoming United Nations Conference on Trade and Development,.Y are all tangible realities which fill us with hope and demonstrate that the United Nations is not a mere entelechy and that its moral influence is gradually leading the nations towards the practical application of the principles of the Charter. 23. The need for the existence of the United Nations if peace is to be strengthened and a better future ensured for mankind was clearly emphasized when, in his encyclical, Pacem in terris, the late Pope stated: l!It is Our earnest wish that the United Nations Organization-in its structure and in its means-may become ever more equal to the magnitude and nobility of its tasks and that the day may come when every human being will find therein an effective safeguard for the rights which derive directly from his dignity as a person, and which are therefore universal, inviolable and inalienable rights. 1121 24. The Secretary-General, with the vast experience he has gained in this Organization, first as representative of his country and then as the SecretaryGeneral of the United Nations, stated, in a speech delivered at Johns Hopkins University in December 1962: ""The United Nations ... does not represent a vague ideal of universal peace and brotherhood which has its appeal only to starry-eyed idealists and moralists. Far from it. It is hard-headed, enlightened sell-interest, the stake that all humanity has in peace and progress and, most important of all, survival, that dictates the need for the United Nations as a practical, institutional embodiment of the needs of nations on a shrinking planet, as a potent and dynamic instrument at the service of all nations, east and west, north as well as south."" That the United Nations is necessary in the world of today is therefore a fact accepted both by the more outstanding intellects and by the ordinary men in every part of the world, who see in it an instrument working for the preservation of peace and for the equality of men. 25. In the broad historic process which is moving towards the attainment of the ideals of the Charter, each General Assembly has marked a step forward. I hope that this eighteenth session will be no exception, and that when we complete our work we shall have the satisfaction of knowing that we have taken a further step in the same direction. 26. The growing number and importance of the items submitted to the consideration of the General Assembly, as also the great increase in the number of Member States, makes it essential for us to adopt methods of work which will enable us to reconcile the need for free and full discussion of items, alIowing every delegation that so wishes to speak in the debates, with the necessity of completing our proceedings within the time-limit normally set for the General Assembly. 27. Both from the practical point of view and that of the convenience of Member States, and from the political point of view and that of the prestige of the United Nations, it is desirable that the work of the regular session of the General Assembly should not extend beyond the normal period. My eminent predecessor, Sir Muhammad Zafrulla Khan, managed to demonstrate that this is not only desirable but possible. I in turn hope that this year too, with the cooperation of all the delegations here present, we shall be able to bring our work to a successful conclusion within the normal term of this session. In this connexion I venture to draw the attention of representatives to the importance of the Report of the Ad Hoc Committee on the Improvement of the Methods of Work of the General Assembly [A/5423], which will be submitted to them for consideration during this session. This report, as we all know, is the outcome of the happy initiative of the distinguished President of the fifteenth session, Mr. Mongi Slim, and it reflects the experience accumulated during the eighteen years in which the United Nations has been in being. 28. The importance which the United Nations has acquired compels it to adapt its methods of work to the increasing demands it is called upon to satisfy. The efficiency of the Organization will depend to a great extent on the efficiency of its methods of work. We must all co-operate in making it a ready and effective instrument, responding to the needs of the moment and prepared to face those of the future. 29. Despite all the divergent views, conflicting interests and passions which must naturally find expression in an international parliament, we also share ideals and aspirations which constitute an invaluable common denominator permitting us to smooth out our differences and helping us to achieve acceptable solutions. Many a difficulty can be overcome if we put aside the often artificially created fears and prejudices which distort reality and hamper understanding. Moreover, a sound interpretation of the principles of the Charter presupposes that they are to be applied impartially; the principles and precepts of the Charter are the same for all; we should not exempt some from what we demand of others, nor excuse in some what in others we condemn; such inconststencies weaken the moral force of the Assembly and breed mistrust and scepticism. 30. I have every confidence that the debates which will take place during this session and in which so many eminent statesmen from all over the world will participate, will proceed in an atmosphere of understanding, harmony and mutual respect and will inGrease the trust placed by the peoples of the world in the United Nations; and that, while they obviously c annot solve all the serious problems facing the world today, they will at least help to clear the ground for the solution of those problems. :n. The United Nations is, in a sense I amirror which reflects the world, and the spirit in which our debates are conducted is bound to spread beyond these walls to a.ll the nations of the globe.
32. Fortunately, this session opens in an auspicious atmosphere. International tension has been reduced by the welcome signature of the Moscow Treaty, on the prohibition of nuclear tests, and in all parts of the world men's fears are replaced by hope. 33. I beseech Divine Providence to enlighten our minds and to unify our efforts so that, thus inspired and united, we may bring to a happy conclusion our appointed task of maintaining peace among nations and promoting the progress and well-being of all mankind. 34, I shall now adjourn the meeting. Eachofthe Main Committees will proceed, in consecutive order, to elect its Chairman in this hall. We shall begin with the First Committee. As soon as these elections have been completed the General Assembly will convene again in plenary meeting to elect the thirteen VicePresidents of the eighteenth session.

10102,"Lyndon B. Johnson, Presidential Inauguration Speech",https://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/johnson.asp,Lyndon B. Johnson,President (United States),Inauguration Speech,1965,,"My fellow countrymen, on this occasion, the oath I have taken before you and before God is not mine alone, but ours together. We are one nation and one people. Our fate as a nation and our future as a people rest not upon one citizen, but upon all citizens.

This is the majesty and the meaning of this moment.

For every generation, there is a destiny. For some, history decides. For this generation, the choice must be our own.

Even now, a rocket moves toward Mars. It reminds us that the world will not be the same for our children, or even for ourselves m a short span of years. The next man to stand here will look out on a scene different from our own, because ours is a time of change-- rapid and fantastic change bearing the secrets of nature, multiplying the nations, placing in uncertain hands new weapons for mastery and destruction, shaking old values, and uprooting old ways.

Our destiny in the midst of change will rest on the unchanged character of our people, and on their faith.

THE AMERICAN COVENANT

They came here--the exile and the stranger, brave but frightened-- to find a place where a man could be his own man. They made a covenant with this land. Conceived in justice, written in liberty, bound in union, it was meant one day to inspire the hopes of all mankind; and it binds us still. If we keep its terms, we shall flourish.

JUSTICE AND CHANGE

First, justice was the promise that all who made the journey would share in the fruits of the land.

In a land of great wealth, families must not live in hopeless poverty. In a land rich in harvest, children just must not go hungry. In a land of healing miracles, neighbors must not suffer and die unattended. In a great land of learning and scholars, young people must be taught to read and write.

For the more than 30 years that I have served this Nation, I have believed that this injustice to our people, this waste of our resources, was our real enemy. For 30 years or more, with the resources I have had, I have vigilantly fought against it. I have learned, and I know, that it will not surrender easily.

But change has given us new weapons. Before this generation of Americans is finished, this enemy will not only retreat--it will be conquered.

Justice requires us to remember that when any citizen denies his fellow, saying, ""His color is not mine,"" or ""His beliefs are strange and different,"" in that moment he betrays America, though his forebears created this Nation.

LIBERTY AND CHANGE

Liberty was the second article of our covenant. It was self- government. It was our Bill of Rights. But it was more. America would be a place where each man could be proud to be himself: stretching his talents, rejoicing in his work, important in the life of his neighbors and his nation.

This has become more difficult in a world where change and growth seem to tower beyond the control and even the judgment of men. We must work to provide the knowledge and the surroundings which can enlarge the possibilities of every citizen.

The American covenant called on us to help show the way for the liberation of man. And that is today our goal. Thus, if as a nation there is much outside our control, as a people no stranger is outside our hope.

Change has brought new meaning to that old mission. We can never again stand aside, prideful in isolation. Terrific dangers and troubles that we once called ""foreign"" now constantly live among us. If American lives must end, and American treasure be spilled, in countries we barely know, that is the price that change has demanded of conviction and of our enduring covenant.

Think of our world as it looks from the rocket that is heading toward Mars. It is like a child's globe, hanging in space, the continents stuck to its side like colored maps. We are all fellow passengers on a dot of earth. And each of us, in the span of time, has really only a moment among our companions.

How incredible it is that in this fragile existence, we should hate and destroy one another. There are possibilities enough for all who will abandon mastery over others to pursue mastery over nature. There is world enough for all to seek their happiness in their own way.

Our Nation's course is abundantly clear. We aspire to nothing that belongs to others. We seek no dominion over our fellow man. but man's dominion over tyranny and misery.

But more is required. Men want to be a part of a common enterprise--a cause greater than themselves. Each of us must find a way to advance the purpose of the Nation, thus finding new purpose for ourselves. Without this, we shall become a nation of strangers.

UNION AND CHANGE

The third article was union. To those who were small and few against the wilderness, the success of liberty demanded the strength of union. Two centuries of change have made this true again.

No longer need capitalist and worker, farmer and clerk, city and countryside, struggle to divide our bounty. By working shoulder to shoulder, together we can increase the bounty of all. We have discovered that every child who learns, every man who finds work, every sick body that is made whole--like a candle added to an altar--brightens the hope of all the faithful.

So let us reject any among us who seek to reopen old wounds and to rekindle old hatreds. They stand in the way of a seeking nation.

Let us now join reason to faith and action to experience, to transform our unity of interest into a unity of purpose. For the hour and the day and the time are here to achieve progress without strife, to achieve change without hatred--not without difference of opinion, but without the deep and abiding divisions which scar the union for generations.

THE AMERICAN BELIEF

Under this covenant of justice, liberty, and union we have become a nation--prosperous, great, and mighty. And we have kept our freedom. But we have no promise from God that our greatness will endure. We have been allowed by Him to seek greatness with the sweat of our hands and the strength of our spirit.

I do not believe that the Great Society is the ordered, changeless, and sterile battalion of the ants. It is the excitement of becoming--always becoming, trying, probing, falling, resting, and trying again--but always trying and always gaining.

In each generation, with toil and tears, we have had to earn our heritage again.

If we fail now, we shall have forgotten in abundance what we learned in hardship: that democracy rests on faith, that freedom asks more than it gives, and that the judgment of God is harshest on those who are most favored.

If we succeed, it will not be because of what we have, but it will be because of what we are; not because of what we own, but, rather because of what we believe.

For we are a nation of believers. Underneath the clamor of building and the rush of our day's pursuits, we are believers in justice and liberty and union, and in our own Union. We believe that every man must someday be free. And we believe in ourselves.

Our enemies have always made the same mistake. In my lifetime--in depression and in war--they have awaited our defeat. Each time, from the secret places of the American heart, came forth the faith they could not see or that they could not even imagine. It brought us victory. And it will again.

For this is what America is all about. It is the uncrossed desert and the unclimbed ridge. It is the star that is not reached and the harvest sleeping in the unplowed ground. Is our world gone? We say ""Farewell."" Is a new world coming? We welcome it--and we will bend it to the hopes of man.

To these trusted public servants and to my family and those close friends of mine who have followed me down a long, winding road, and to all the people of this Union and the world, I will repeat today what I said on that sorrowful day in November 1963: ""I will lead and I will do the best I can.""

But you must look within your own hearts to the old promises and to the old dream. They will lead you best of all.

For myself, I ask only, in the words of an ancient leader: ""Give me now wisdom and knowledge, that I may go out and come in before this people: for who can judge this thy people, that is so great?"""

That they must stop thinking in terms of settling disputes, by War. And if I may say so with respect, to Mr. Krushev, statesmen of the world cannot use words like 'Over our dead bodies'., because that means 'War'.  And all those differences, including stubborn differences over Berlin, however long the negotiation may last. Because ladies and gentlemen, there is no other choice before men. It was once said in an old dictum, that war was a continuation of policy by other means and that it ceased in the 20th century to have any meaning at all. I believe that the truth about nuclear war is as clear to Mr. Krushev as it is to us. His open renunciation of the use of war as an instrument of policy almost amounts to new Doctrine, and almost amounts I believe to a total rethinking of soviet plans for the future of commony. The emergence of China, along a largely undivided frontier, the failure of Cuba which is infact a failure of the use of force and blackmail. The urgent questions of economic priority, within the Soviet Union, where people are tasting and want more of the fuller life, all brings hope for the future, and if therefore war which has been the traditional method by which we have setttled our disputes or tried to settle them from the beginning of time, are to be ruled out of order now certainly by the major powers, and if the aggressive means are to give way to self-preservation, then again Mr. Butler will go out in the councils of the world, and ask people everywhere to turn its thinking back on its tracks full circle. It will not be easy for the communists to draw force from their program, but it must be done. It will not be easy for any of us and we have ot been guity in Europe over many centuries, to put our bad habits behind us, but it must be done. And in leading this crusade, the foreign secretary will have the backing of the whole British people. Because all our experience and diplomacy and international contacts, over the century, has given us not only the right, but the duty to lead this world into this new way. Athens alone with its immortal glorios, is free to decide its future at an election under British, American and French observation. The Russian-dominated Polish Government has been encouraged to make enormous and wrongful inroads upon Germany, and mass expulsions of millions of Germans on a scale grievous and undreamed-of are now taking place. The Communist parties, which were very small in all these Eastern States of Europe, have been raised to pre-eminence and power far beyond their numbers and are seeking everywhere to obtain totalitarian control. Polied governements are prevailing in nearly every case, and so far, except in Czechoslovakia, there is no true democracy. Turkey and Persia are both profoundly alarmed and distributed at the claims which are made upon them and at the pressure being exerted by the Moscow Government. An attempt is being made by the Russians in Berlin to build up a quasi-Communist party in their zone of Occupied Germany by showing special favors to groups of left-wing German leaders. At the end of the fighting last June, the American and British Armies withdrew Westwards, in accordance with an earlier agreement, to a depth at some points of 150 miles on a front of nearly 400 miles to allow the Russians to occupy this vast expanse of territory which the Estern Democracies had conquered. If now the Soviet Government tries, by separate action, to build up a pro-Communist Germany in their cross, this will cause new serious difficulties in the British and American zones, and will give the defeated Germans the power of putting themselves up to auction between the Soviets and the Western Democracies. Whatever conclusions may be drawn from these facts - and facts they are - this is certainly not the Liberated Europe we fought to build up. Nor is it one which contains the essentials of permanent peace.
Longer this is delayed, the more essential to govern it will become. From what I have seen of our Russian friends and Allies during the war, I am convinced that there is nothing they admire so much as strength, and there is nothing for which they have less respect than for military weakness. For that "
10104,"Ludwig Erhard, Chancellor Inauguration Speech",https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/europe/de-erhard.htm,Ludwig Erhard,Chancellor (Germany),Inauguration Speech,1963,,"Ludwig Erhard (CDU) was Minister of Economics during Konrad Adenauer’s term in office (1949–1963). His name is linked to the introduction of the Deutschmark (D-Mark) in 1948 (called the “currency reform”). Erhard is regarded as the father of the social market economy, and the father of the ""Economic Miracle"" (Wirtschaftswunder ).

Ludwig Erhard had emerged already in 1948 as the economic architect of the British-American Bizone. In contrast to many other German politicians of the time, he agreed with General Clay that socialization of the German economy had to be avoided. Erhard was to become one of two politicians who shaped the Federal Republic more than anyone else. Together with Konrad Adenauer, the political architect who anchored the new West German state in Western Europe, reconciled it with its neighbors, and closely attached it to the Atlantic Alliance, Ludwig Erhard set the course for economic reconstruction and earned himself the title, “father of the economic miracle (Wirtschaftswunder).”

Germany's economic growth during the first decades after the war at times overshadowed its marked success at joining the international community. In 1945 the country's economy was shattered. A good part of what survived was later dismantled and carried off by the victorious Allies. Within Germany there was much argument about how to rebuild the economy and what its nature should be. Socialist politicians argued for a central distribution system, extensive state controls, and the nationalization of banks and industry. Their main opponent was Ludwig Erhard, a liberal economist appointed to head the office of economic affairs in the Bizone, who later became minister for economics and ultimately FRG chancellor (1963-66), succeeding Adenauer.

Erhard's concept of a socially responsive market economy based on free trade and private enterprise, aided by the infusion of capital through the Marshall Plan, proved to be the ideal basis for the strong recovery of the West German economy, culminating in the economic miracle (Wirtschaftswunder ) of the 1950s. In some areas, for instance in housing and in agriculture, prevailing circumstances required the introduction of price controls and subsidies. Controls to prevent the formation of cartels and to foster monetary stability also remained the state's responsibility. The state likewise furthered the accumulation of private capital and protected ordinary citizens by establishing a generous system of social services that included statutory health, unemployment, and pension insurance programs.

West Germany's economy functioned very well for several decades, and the country became one of the world's wealthiest. Thanks to the strong social welfare component and the system of codetermination, which gave workers in factories some say about their management, West German industry enjoyed a long period of labor peace. The export-oriented economy received another boost with the creation of the European Economic Community (EEC) by the Treaty of Rome in March 1957. West Germany was one of the EEC's founding members.

Erhard’s concept for the German economy became known as the “social market economy.” Together with his colleagues mostly from the University of Freiburg, Professor Erhard had secretly begun to develop the concept during the years of Nazi rule. The so-called Freiburg School was searching for a new model for the postwar economy that would avoid the pitfalls of the Weimar Republic and Nazi era. As expressed in the definition, it consisted of two strands of ideals and ideas.

In looking for a market economy, Erhard and the Freiburg School proclaimed that freedom of initiative was to be one central idea. The role of the government was to be limited to the protection of the competitive environment from monopolistic tendencies. Under the motto “as little government as possible, as much government as necessary,” the state was to play a mainly regulatory role in the market economy. Erhard wanted to avoid the kind of connivance between big business and government that had helped to bring Hitler to power.

The second strand of ideas for the social market economy stemmed from the desire to maintain and promote social peace and justice. In the 1920s and 1930s, the political battles between left and right had been fierce. Adenauer and Erhard both wanted to avoid a climate of confrontation that could lead to the re-emergence of radical movements. In 1948 the Deutschmark replaced the old “Reichsmark” as the currency in West Germany. Ludwig Erhard virtually single-handedly also revoked price fixing for most goods. Where previously the state had determined the price of certain products, from then on prices were regulated by supply and demand.

Ludwig Erhard was an early advocate of a liberal, social economic order, both during his time as Minister of Economics and prior to that as Professor of Economics. In West Germany that led to an unbroken period of economic growth that lasted around one and a half decades.

Germany became one of the world’s leading industrial and export nations. It is because of this that Erhard is regarded as the author of Germany’s post-war “economic miracle”. The optimism of the “man with the cigar” was infectious. His motto – “prosperity for all” – became a reality for millions of Germans after the dark years of Hitler tyranny and hardship. For many years Ludwig Erhard was the most popular politician in West Germany.

Ludwig Erhard succeeded Adenauer as chancellor. Under Erhard's leadership, the CDU/CSU-FDP coalition remained in power until 1966. Erhard's more liberal economic policy toward the East European states that maintained diplomatic relations with East Germany made maintaining the Hallstein Doctrine difficult. In addition, his position of favoring close coordination of German foreign policy with the United States was resisted by the ""Gaullists,"" even those in his own party, who favored a continuation of Adenauer's close relations with France.

In terms of foreign policy, Chancellor Erhard attached particular importance to relations with the United States and Israel. By the time Adenauer left office in 1963 (a month before Kennedy was assassinated), a dispute was growing in Germany between those who wanted closer ties to France and de Gaulle and those (called the “Atlanticists”) who insisted on close ties with the United States. This dispute divided the government of Adenauer’s successor, Ludwig Erhard, and continued until de Gaulle’s resignation from office in 1969. Erhard also began slowly opening up to the East by establishing trade missions in Poland, Romania, Hungary and Bulgaria. The CDU/CSU did well in the elections of 1965, but relations with the FDP had deteriorated. A recession and a budget crisis caused the FDP to drop out of the coalition. Erhard ruled with a minority government for a short time, but after the opposition's significant gains in several Land elections, his party formed a new coalition government with the SPD. After 14 years as Minister of Economics, Erhard was Federal Chancellor for only three years. Disagreements over economic and fiscal policy issues in 1966 led to the end of the CDU/CSU/FDP coalition government. Erhard resigned as chancellor in November 1966, less successful in that position than he had been as the ""father of the economic miracle.""

10110,"Carlos Sosa Rodríguez (es), PGA Inauguration Speech",http://undocs.org/en/A/PV.1286,Carlos Sosa Rodríguez (es),President of the General Assembly,Inauguration Speech,1963,,"17. The PRESIDENT: It is with a profound sense of gratitude and hUmility that I take this Chair to serve you as President of the nineteenth se'ssion of the General Assembly. By yoUr unanimous decision you have bestowed on' me·an honour which goes far beyond my humble person. for this is a tribute to Africa and to Ghana in particular. and above all to miW0ns of people of African descent eV'erywhere. 18. It is my earnest prayer that with your ready cooperation I shall carry out the onerous burden which devolves upon me at this session and thus requite the confidence which you have so ungrudgingly placed in me. 19. I come from a young but dynamic country in Africa. For centuries and centuries it smarted under the exploitation of European adventurers who called it the ""Gold Coast"". Then for more than one hundreci years it was under British rule. It was not until 6 March 1957 that the Gold Coast became a free and independent Ghana and was admitted to the United Nations as a Member State. Since then Ghana has played an active role in international affairs by throwing its weight solidly on tL~ side of peace. Ghana has an unshakable faith in the United Nations and has consistently supported the purposes and principles of the Charter. 20. In Africa. Ghana has bent all its energies. in concert with other sister African States. to the building of a united Africa in the cause of peace. At the very start of Ghana's independence, the President of Ghana told the world that ""Ghana's independence is meaningless unless it is linkedwith the total liberation of the African cont.inent"". It can be said that. since 1957. Af;ica has not been the same again. It is a measure of the strides Africa has made that within seven years the number of independent African States has increased from eight to thirty-six. Today we have witnessed the renaissance of the African personality here. in this very Assembly. Indeed. who would have thought in 1945 that a representative of ""Afrique noire"" would today be presiding over the General Assembly of the United Nations. 21. Yes. nineteen years ago the voice of Africa was frail and hardly audible. For centuries the personality of Africa was truncated by dint of foreign domination, exploitation and oppression. For centuries Africa suffered the indignity of slavery and spoliation unparalleled in the history of mankind. Africanhum:i.l1ity suffered the worst form of degradation and devalua~ tion. and yet Africans are not bitter. Was it not Mohamed Ahmed Mahgoub, the Foreign Minister of Sudan, who once said: ""The African is naturally tolerant; we are prepared to forgive, for ours is not a creed of hate."" 22. There was an international conspiracy to oblit~ erate Africa's glorious past. When vision was short and knOWledge scant. men called Africa the llDark Continent"".and some historians even made futile attempts to denigrate Africa's contribution to world civilization. To them the exploits and grandeur of the great empires of ancient Ghana. MaliandSonghay, the powerful kingdoms of Ashanti, Buganda, Ife and Benin, belonged to the realms of mythology. To them, before the advent of Europeans, all was darkness and void. 23. But we. who believe in the African personality are conscious of our ancient roots. We draw strength an6 insriration from our glorious past, from the efflorescence of the powerful andenlightenedciviliza~ tion along the banks of the life-giVing Nile, from the famous institutions of advanced studies in Timbuktu and from the glorious existence of Ethiopia.
24. Today, divided and mutilated, Africa isregaining its dignity and independence and is steadily moving towards its determined goal of continental unity and total liberation. The Organization of African Unity, in flpite of severe handicaps, is tacklingAfricanproblems with vigour and imagination. Mrica is discovering its ancient glory and pride in a brave new world. Its future is now indissolubly linked with the destiny of Asia, Latin A.merica and the rest of the world. Africans are resolved to play an effective role in world affairs. Indeed, they have already begun to make fruitful contributions to the solution of many difficult problems facing the United Nations. And why not? After all, the famous dictum of the Roman thinker, Pliny the Elder, has never lost its relevance. namely, e;;::: Africa semper al1quid novi-out of Mrica. always something new. 25. The United Nations, conceived in the sweat, tears and blood of a world conflagration, has been huffeted by both extromes of fortune for nineteen years, but it has shown a wGaderful resilience in the face of crises whichhave threatened its very existence, The opening session of eachGeneralAssembly shou)d, therefore, serve as an occasion to reaffirm our faith in the United Nations and to redecticate ourselves to its purposes, ideals and principles. 26. S')metimes we tend to become disheartened when we consider the long list of problems confronting the world. We have tough problems such as the present financial and constitutional crisis due to peacekeeping operations, Korea, Viet-Nam, Germany, general and complete disarmament, decolonization, aparthe.,d, refugees, huma.""'1 rights and economic development. Some of these problems have been tackled with vigour by the United Nations. Others, like divided Germany, have not even been properly discussed at this Assembly.. But it is my conviction that, .siven a large fund of goodwill and a spirit of tolerance and comp:romise, we can grasp the nettle and take the sting out of these seemingly intractable problems. There are a few bright spots in the history of our Organization when these qualities have saved the day and dissipated the spectre of failure. It is my belief that this spirit of tolerance and compromise will once again prevail in the search for a firm solution to the financial crisis resulting from peacekeeping operations. 27. This should give us hope that in the fire and crucible of crisis and danger we shall forge an organization which will fulfil its primary role of saving ""succeeding generations from the scourge of war"". 28. This is the greatest challenge of our time. There is a great commotion in our moral world. We have witnessed during the life of the United Nations conflicts in various parts of the world. It is true that no single Power would be foolhardy enough to start a war, but there are rumblings beneath the surface of the world situation, and, as the late Dag HammarskjOld once said, ""politically, the world si\:uation represents a pi.cture of interlocking stalemates n. Is it impossible for us to take another look at these stalemates and make fresh attempts to solve them? Perhaps we may give thought to the setting up of some ad hoc committees to study critical questions and endeavour to find solutions to them.
29. Let us do some heart searching. Does the-3 peace of the 'vorld depend upon the United Nations or does the U~ .~tld Nations depend upon peace between the great Powers? I must say here that it lies within your powl~r, all of you representatives from Member States, to make the United Nations a strong organization, a bastion of peace and security. We should not be hemmed in by .age~old ideas of power politics. We should make full use of the Charter of the United Nations,. which is a living and dyna.""llic document. It is essential for us to maintain inviolate the courage of our convictions. We should place a great premium on spiritual values, which alone have sustained mankind in times of triumph and tribulation up to the present day. We must all gird our loius to rai.se high the standard of freedom, justice and peace. 30. One of the tragedies of our world today is the scorn with which some view the whole question of international morality. To them it is anathema. They feel that problems can be solved only in terms of powerpolitics and.rigidlegUity or political expediency. What they fail to realize, however, is that our civi~ lization, if it is to survive, should be humanistic and not purely teclmical. I am not advocating the wanton sacrifice of principles we hold so dear, but where some measure of accommodation can pave the way to the solution of a problem, we must not lack the courage to resort to it. We must not be afraid to reconsider our position, to re-examine our attitudes when changing circumstances make that inevitable. It is in this spirit that all of us who have pledged ourselves to observe the aims and purposes of the Charter should approach our responsibility. 31. It is in this spirit also that I approach the task entrusted to me as President of this General Assembly. I am confident that with your support and cooperation I will live up to your expectations. It gives me great courage to face my onerous responsibilities when I look back over the impressive succession of distinguished and dedicated former presidents who have left their imprint on the work of the General Assembly. Their record will serve me as a guide and inspiration. 32. And now, I deem it a great pleasure to pay a special tribute to my immediate predecessor, my friend and colleague, Mr. Carlos Sosa Rodrl'gl.lez. whose efficient, dignified and impartial conduct of the eighteenth session of the General Assembly has won him universal applause and admiration. I shall endeavour, with your help, to follow in his footsteps and draw inspiration from his impressive record. 33. I also know that ~n all my endeavours I can cO\mt on the wisdom, knowledge and assistance of our Secretary-Gellerl'l.l. Let me here thank him for the magnificent work he is doing. He is in firm control atthe head ofthe Secretariat, where his able lieutenants are giving of their best. 34. We hava on the agenda of this nineteenth session many burning questions which call for our urgent and dedicated attention. Let us approach these problems in a sober and earnest mood devoid of all rancour. Our debates should reflect a genuine desire to seek solutions and to reach decisions. I am confident that the worthy precedents set by prf3vious sessions will be scrupulously obsliU'ved~ so that we may effectively complete the varx<ms items within the time available to us. 35. It will also be my special privilege an:i pleasure to preside over the admission of the new Member States of Malawi, Zambia and Malta. The birth of every new State is for us an occasion Qf great rejoicing, fQr it signifies the progressive eradicatiQn of the cancer of cQlonialism. Furthermore, the injection c,f new blood into our Organization will assure it a Vigorous and·fruitful existence and a realization of its goal of universality. 36. Let us all hope that in our lifetime it will be possible for us to see the complete eradication of domination and racialism. Let us attack the ramparts of oppression, ignorance, disease and poverty, and fulfil man's yearning fQr universal prosperity and progress. Let us work for humanity. not merely for nationality. Let us continue to work 101' peace. It is to this end that we should bend all our energies. This session of the General Assembly should take us a ssep nearp-1' our objective. 37. I implore you to approach the work of this session in a spirit of frai1kness, courage and dedication and, with singleness of purpose, strive to bequeath to succeeding generations 8...""\ effective world Organization, capable of ensuring the peace, happiness and well-being of mankind. The United Nations is our international Ship of State. It should cut through the icebergs and weather every storm. It must sail on. As the poet Longfellow put it: .••• sail on, 0 Ship of state! Sail on, 0 Union, strong and great! Humanity with all its fears, With all the hopes offuture years, Is hanging breathless'on th!fate! 38. What has begun as an Assembly of crisis should end as an Assembly of harmony andpeace. May Divine Providence guide our deliberations."
10111,"Sir Harold Wilson, PM Inauguration Speech",http://www.britishpoliticalspeech.org/speech-archive.htm?speech=162,Sir Harold Wilson,Prime Minister (United Kingdom),Inauguration Speech,1964,,"Mr. Chairman, Prime Minister of Sweden, Lord Attlee and fellow delegates, the section of the report we are now discussing records the main events of the General Election. But I want to spend my time this afternoon not so much looking back over that exciting and hard fought contest but looking forward to the work of the Labour Government.

Before I do this, however, let me add my tribute to what has been said by you, Mr. Chairman, and by other speakers this morning about the tremendous efforts made by every member of the Party in the historic weeks that ended on 15 October, and indeed, over all the months which preceded the campaign.

First, may I pay my tribute to Transport House, to the General Secretary and the National Agent and all who worked with them at headquarters, in the Regions and in the Agency Services; to the Publicity Department who, it will be generally agreed, provided a service such as we have never seen before in any general election; to those responsible for the broadcasts and for the organisation of the meetings. But, most of all, I pay my tribute to the workers of this great Movement throughout the country, in safe seats, in marginal seats and in Tory seats, not yet marginal, for their efforts and for their dedication.

Let me make this clear. None of us, whether as Ministers or as Members of Parliament are here through our own efforts or our own virtues. We are here because of the countless thousands of our supporters, animated not by thought of personal advantage but by devotion to a great ideal: we are here because of millions of our fellow countrymen who look to us to provide a strong Britain, a healthy Britain, and to create and maintain a new and just order of society.

We shall not fail them nor shall we forget our debt to them in all we have to do.

The Report refers to our narrow majority. But let us not understate the achievement in having reversed in one campaign an adverse trend that had been at work with increasing force over four previous elections, and in having turned the Conservative majority of over 100 seats into an overall Labour majority.

Let me say how, in the light of that narrow majority, we have decided to fulfil our responsibility as a Government. At the first meeting I had with my colleagues, I expressed the view - and this was the position of all of us - that while the narrow Parliamentary majority was undoubtedly a headache for the Leader of the House and the Chief Whip, while it would require the more regular attendance of Ministers in Parliament than is usual (we are welcome there, not for our blue eyes, but for the pair of feet we take to the Division lobbies) it must not affect our work as a Government.

I certainly do not underrate the tremendous load falling on members of the Parliamentary Party who by day and by night are working to carry through into statutory effect the principles for which they fought.

If Members’ salaries have now at last been brought to an adequate level, we can certainly say that they are geared not only to time worked, but to a substantial increase in Parliamentary productivity.

But so far as the function of Government is concerned, we were resolved - let me make it plain - and we are resolved, to fulfil the duties of Government irrespective of short-run Parliamentary - still more - electioneering con­siderations.

For two years, Britain has been without a Government because two successive Prime Ministers so conducted the nation’s affairs as to think only of the electoral consequences of any decision they might be contemplating. For 12 months, up to the election, the Government was operating under the instructions of a Prime Minister, who on taking office said:

From this moment on, the fact that there is a general election ahead of us must never be out of our minds. Every act that we take, every attitude that we strike, every speech that we make in Parliament or elsewhere must have that in mind.

Having been entrusted by the nation with the duties of Government, we intend to govern. No decision will be burked, no deci­sion will be trimmed because of the possibility - however remote in our own minds - of an early election.

If we are to look down at our feet the whole time, picking our way through some real or imagined electoral mud, we shall not be able to see the road ahead, still less shall we be able to see the stars that should guide our path.

To proceed any other way would make good Government impossible. I believe quite frankly that it would be bad electoral tactics too, because I think the people of Britain want to see a Government acting with firmness and taking the decisions, popular or unpopular, that are called for.

We have not, of course, lacked advice. From the moment we took office a beguiling tempta­tion was presented to us. The suggestion was that because we had no overall majority of votes in the country, we had no mandate to act in accordance with the principles we had put before the country.

On this argument, no Tory Government from 1951 to 1964 would have had any mandate whatsoever - no mandate for Suez, no mandate for the Rent Act, no mandate for Selwyn Lloyd. But I cannot recall this new doctrine of ‘a majority without a mandate’ being put forward in those years by those same Conservative sources which suddenly dis­covered it to be a fundamental provision of the British Constitution.

But, of course, things have changed: we have a Labour Government so the constitution is different. And now we are told that while the majority does not give us a mandate the twin claims of statesmanship and democracy require us to adopt the policies, in so far as they were identifiable, of a Conserva­tive Opposition which has neither mandate nor majority and whose policies had been decisively rejected by the British electorate.

In our legislative programme for the present Parliamentary session, set out in the speech from the Throne on November 3, we made clear our intention to bring before Parliament the measures which we had promised to carry out during the election. Indeed, practically every major proposal set out in our Manifesto is included in the programme which is now before Parliament. I can understand the dis­appointment, even rage, which this programme produced. It was well expressed by a Vicky cartoon showing two Blimps in a club, one of whom said to the other, ‘I always said you couldn’t trust that fellow Wilson - he is doing exactly what he said he was going to do.’

Let me repeat: there is no major item of policy, and few if any minor ones which were set out in my own speeches and broadcasts during and before the election campaign - and I said quite a lot myself in those days - which is not before the House today in the form of legislation or is not in preparation for intro­duction, or is not going through the legislative and administrative machine.

Legislation: from steel to the measure - designed to stop land speculation and profiteer­ing - to take urban building land into public ownership. Action is in hand to extend the workings of democracy in British industry, so that shareholders will be informed of any hitherto secret political donations made in their names and with their money.

Our programme is honest because we believe it to be related to the needs of this country in the 1960s; it is democratic because we sought and obtained the mandate for it; it is socialist in its inspiration, its conception and its formulation.

In the few words with which I wound up our last conference at Scarborough in October 1963, I said then that we should put before the nation a programme designed to restore a sense of economic purpose to the conduct of our national affairs, to restore a sense of social purpose and social justice to our national life, and to increase Britain’s influence and standing among the nations of the world.

Through our domestic policies, there run three golden threads: dynamism, compassion and concern for the liberty of the individual. Let me turn first to the problem of galvanising and dynamising the tired and spiritless economy which we inherited.

First priority indeed, overlying all our policies, is urgent action to deal with the economic position.

No one will now underestimate our econo­mic inheritance, the worst in that its gravity was denied and denied again for political purposes before the election. In January I warned the country of the growing gap between our imports and exports and drew attention to the ominous rise in imports - not materials required for industrial expansion - but, in the main, manufactured goods that we ought to be perfectly capable of making for ourselves on a competitive basis. All we got in reply was a Premier proclaiming pathetically from platform to platform that ‘the economy has seldom, if ever, been stronger.’ The then Chancellor knew the facts at any rate. He pleaded desperately for an early election. This being refused - and we all know why it was refused - it was the plain duty of the Government which decided to cling to office to take relevant and adequate action to deal with the economic situation. Action taken then would have averted the need for the much tougher action we have had to take. But, of course, to have done so would have been to confess their failure after 13 years’ responsi­bility for the nation’s affairs. And so the situation got worse, though in the election itself every attempt was made to make light of it. I was attacked by the Tories for drawing the country’s attention to the fact that we were keeping going only by borrowing to the tune of £1 million a day. Even I was guilty of understating the position. The deficit was then running at £2 millions a day. And this was the reality behind the election posters which boasted of Tory prosperity.

It was symbolic that only an hour or two before Labour was asked to form an administra­tion, the September trade figures were pub­lished showing one of the biggest monthly trade gaps of the year.

From the start we treated the economic problem as one of the highest priority. We had to act quickly and relevantly to stop the bleeding. We introduced a system of charges on imports, necessary if imports were to be kept within bounds but doubly regrettable to us. I say ‘doubly’ regrettable because we were and always have been committed to vigorous action to remove restraints on world trade and to get a freer trading world; equally we were anxious that no one should feel that these temporary charges provided still more protection or encouragement to slothful attitudes in industry.

These charges had to be imposed: we regret their effects on our friends in EFTA and the Commonwealth and the rest of the trading world. I repeat they will not be kept on a moment longer than is necessary, that we do not regard them as providing more than a tourniquet to stop the bleeding.

But at the same time we began an urgent attack on the endemic problems of British industry, and above all the problems of increasing our exports. New and powerful departments of State were created: the Department of Economic Affairs under our Deputy Leader to take over responsibility for physical planning, responsibility for the preparation and implementation of a develop­ment plan aimed at an increase in those sectors of the economy where strength was imperative, particularly those most relevant to exports and to capital investment.

A Ministry of Technology under Frank Cousins to mobilise our scientific resources and, more to the point, to see that the work of our scientists - as good as any the world can produce - was more quickly and effectively applied to industrial processes. This was quick Government action to redeem the pledge I gave at Scarborough when we last met.

While our scientific effort is as good as that of any other country, we are still far too slow in applying technology to industry: in far too many cases new industrial processes which stemmed from British discoveries and inven­tions are worked out by keener and more practical industrialists overseas and Britain left in the humiliating position of paying royalties on a British invention.

We are planning an urgent attack on the problems of those sectors of industry where Britain not long ago led the world and where our failure to innovate meant not only that we were losing our impact on export markets but that we were rapidly becoming major importers. We are planning - this is Frank’s job - to redeploy our scientific and technological resources so that scientists and engineers who have hitherto been working on costly research and development projects for defence can be turned over to R and D in civil industry to produce new processes, new inventions, new industries with which we are once again going to lead the world.

But no one expected - or at least I hope no one expected - the export factories, the investment, the modernisation, the innovation all to become effective in a matter of six or seven weeks. Even with George Lowthian you cannot build a new export factory in seven weeks. What we have to tell the world is that this work has begun, and begun with a will and a purpose, and that before long we shall have a dynamic, robust, thriving, competitive economy.

We reinforced the measures to redeploy our physical resources, to streamline our industry, with a tough budget to ensure that action in the physical field was not frustrated in the financial; and I would pay my tribute today to the cour­age of our Chancellor of the Exchequer.

I am not going to speculate into the reasons which led to a withdrawal of sterling. Nor is there any profit in condemning those who for any motive were willing to put political prejudice above what should be their first loyalty to this country and to the economic strength of Britain and the sterling area.

But just as import charges were imposed because they were relevant to an import drain, so the increase in bank rate was imposed because it was relevant to a financial movement of this kind and this order. This was reinforced by the massive concentration of financial resources by the world community. We had always envisaged that this would be necessary. In my speech in Swansea, which some of you heard, I said then that with a growing export-import problem, stripped of the ability to introduce quick measures that would be needed in the industrial sphere, we should not hesitate to use the reserves and to use interest rates ruthlessly to protect the £. Let no one be in any doubt about our willing­ness to take every measure that is necessary.

But let me make this clear; this is not a return to Selwyn Lloyd. We do not believe, as our predecessors did, that the way to deal with a kind of crisis which is endemic in the industrial structure with which they left us, is to bring the whole economy shuddering to a stop.

The way to a strong £ is through a strong economy, not by creating unemployment, not by holding production down, raising costs, deterring investment and creating the inse­curity which breeds restrictive practices on both sides of industry.

The answer to our problem is to make industry dynamic, to stir more of our manufacturers out of their slothful preoccupation with the easy home market, and it is what we are doing. The answer to our problem is the measures we are taking to increase industrial efficiency, to build up our exports and to substitute home production for imports wherever this can be achieved competitively and economically; to broaden the base of our economy with capital investment; through the training of skilled manpower and the encouragement to accept change, which this Government is providing, to enable us to expand without running into strains and stresses such as have revealed themselves in past periods of expansion.

The measures we have taken, the further measures we shall be taking in the coming weeks, will create the conditions in which these problems are going to be solved. I believe that our people will respond to this challenge because our history shows that they misjudge us who underrate our ability as a nation to move, and to move decisively when the need arises. They misjudged our temper after Dunkirk, but we so mobilised our latent and untapped strength that apparent defeat was turned into a great victory. I believe that that spirit of Dunkirk will once again carry us through to success.

For as I told the American people in a ceremony on the White House lawn earlier this week, we have great reserves of skill and craftsmanship, of science and technology, of talent for production and design and sales, which now they have been called into battle will produce a result which will delight our friends and surprise the world. This is the mood of Britain today, the determination, the readiness, the eagerness for change which swept Labour to power, and which will now sweep our country to victory in the economic field.

Let us be clear what this means. It means new aggressiveness, a new cutting edge in our export drive. It means a new willingness to modernise and to innovate. It means readiness on all sides of industry to sacrifice short-term gain for the longer-term future. It means an end of ‘I’m all right Jack’ attitudes wherever they may be found. It means a determined attack on restrictive practices on both sides of industry. There is no room in modern Britain for Luddites, be they trade union Luddites or boardroom Luddites. This country cannot afford now - if it ever could afford - unofficial strikes, wasteful stoppages, long, weary arguments about industrial demarcation, any more than we can afford out-of-date industrial methods, industrial promotion based on influence and connection rather than technical ability, or management attitudes which give a higher priority to tax avoidance or the earning of quick, uncoven­anted capital profits than to modernisation and innovation in industrial production methods, or aggressiveness in exports.

Above all, whatever our role in industry, our approach must be not what we can take out of the national pool, but what we can put into it. For only by a massive sense of dedication, by every individual can we get the national sense of purpose that we need. And with economic purpose, social purpose, based on a nation which cares. I quote again those words of President Roosevelt, which I used in my final Party Political Broadcast on 12 October, three days before polling day: ‘Better the occasional faults of a government living in the spirit of compassion, than the consistent omissions of a government frozen in the ice of its own indifference.’

The first Bill we introduced in this Parlia­ment was a small one but one close to my heart; one for which I and the Chief Whip and others have been fighting for years - a simple little measure to restore to local authorities the power to allow old age pensioners and others to travel free on municipal transport under­takings. (Applause) Not much, perhaps, but the whole force of the Tory Party was mobilised against it for nine years. But our major decision in the social field was to raise the level of retirement pensions and other benefits and war pensions, and to abolish prescription charges. And together with that, that long overdue act of social justice - to abolish the earnings rule for widows. For the election we promised early legislation to take our old age pensioners, the long-term sick and disabled out of the rut of poverty in which after 13 years of Conservatism they still remained.

I share your disappointment that although the legislation was quickly introduced, and quickly passed through the Commons, it is not possible to start the payments when they are most needed - in the winter; though special provisions have been made to help those on National Assistance with their fuel costs. But for heaven’s sake, don’t let us get on the defensive about it. Some remarks I have read suggest that this Government, which was prepared in the midst of difficult economic circumstances to act where our predecessors had not acted and - if they had been returned - would not have acted, is a Government of unfeeling Scrooges. Let us put the responsi­bility where it clearly lies. If the Conservative Government of Sir Alec Douglas-Home had decided that pensions should have been increased, and if they had started the preparations in July or August, we could have had these increases in force by Christmas. Even without such an unrealistic assumption; if the Conservatives had only bequeathed to us a machine - perfectly easy to devise given time - which was more flexible and resilient to a Government decision of this kind, we could then, from the moment that Peggy Herbison was authorised by the Commons to go ahead after 16 October, have still had speedier implementation.

Let the country know where the blame lies and let them see for themselves - when we have to face and Peggy has to face Conservative questions and speeches in the House - the nauseating hypocrisy of those who, when they could have acted, did not. Let us .ask the country what it thinks of a Party that has not the courage to vote against the pensions increase, but seeks unworthy electoral capital from voting against the provision of the money to pay for it. Because if you vote for the pensions increase and against Jim Callaghan’s budget, you acquiesce in the end while rejecting the necessary means. This is an example of the irresponsible approach of which they wrongly accused us in the 1959 election, and which Hugh Gaitskell had to face.

Again, our decision to introduce the repeal of prescription charges shows how different our conception of social justice is from that of the Conservatives. In successive economic crises, Tory Chancellors - Mr. Macmillan in 1956, Mr. Selwyn Lloyd in 1961 (aided and abetted by Mr. Enoch Powell; a formidable combination) insisted on placing additional burdens on those least able to hear them, the old and the chronic sick. This was their reaction to economic difficulties. Neither did they, as the economic position improved in preparation for successive elections, remove these burdens even though hundreds of millions were being handed out in tax con­cessions on the eve of each planned election. We have introduced these wide-ranging increases as a right, and as a right of all our citizens, which is due to them because of what they have done for us and the nation; not in any patronising, condescending Tory spirit of ‘donations.’

We have acted firmly and decisively on housing. In every election speech we pledged the Labour Government to repeal the Rent Act and to restore security of tenure to those who had been robbed of that right by the Tories. Here, again, we acted quickly. To prevent a rush of evictions, the Minister of Housing and Local Government introduced immediately a measure to provide security of tenure. Equally, and this is an issue of great importance to our people in our older cities, he has announced to Parliament our intention to fulfil our pledge to proceed with leasehold enfranchisement. I said that our third objective is not merely to maintain but to enhance the freedom of the individual: We are democratic socialists, our Movement exists because we fight for people, not in the mass but as individuals. Because we believe in planning, and precisely because we do, we have to ensure that not only does Socialist planning not infringe freedom but that in everything we do we extend and make more real the freedom of the individual in an increasingly complex society. And, if anyone wanted proof of our determination, they could not find it better than in the widely welcomed appointment of Gerald Gardiner as Lord Chancellor, or our law officers, and the Minister in the Commons who will be occupied full time on working with the Lord Chancellor on measures of law reform.

It was the post-war Labour Government that initiated the right of the individual to sue the Crown and which introduced legal aid. In that spirit, our appointment of law commissioners to cleanse the legal system of the mustiness and fustiness of centuries and our proposal for a Parliamentary Commissioner to examine the grievances of individuals against organised society, are conceived.

You will expect me to say a word about the Parliamentary Opposition. I do not intend to spend much time on them - there are more important things to talk about. But at a time of goodwill, let us spare a thought for them. Let us not condemn them too harshly, for remember that these are men who thought that at birth they were ordained by Providence to rule over their fellow citizens; and to find themselves rudely deprived of the powers they exercised cannot have been easy for them. There may be some who would condemn the tactics and extravagances of individual Con­servative leaders, but let us remember that they are in a competitive situation. It may take a little time while the machinery of the Conservative Party evolves out of the existing democratic system of leadership election a new and more shining example of democracy in action, but even though it may take some time there are already on the Conservative Front Bench some who are turning their minds to the problem of the succession.

Let us, therefore, in judging, recognise the pressures to which they are succumbing. Do not let us be too surprised about the total disunity they are showing on some of the most urgent issues of national policy. Mr. Maudling’s conscience impels him to support our diagnosis of the economic situation and the remedies which we decided were essential; Mr. Heath condemned both. And should these two, after the succession has been decided, ever come to agree with one another, there will always be Mr. Enoch Powell, the Savonarola of modern Conservatism, to burn his leader’s sacred relics. It is a fact that within one month of the Tory Front Bench preparing the fatted calf, or at any rate the shadow fatted calf, for his return, he succeeded in brusquely dismissing any idea of an incomes policy which has been a main theme of Tory economic arguments for so long, in rejecting any idea of economic planning to which we thought the Tories had claimed to be converted - to say nothing of his anti-Commonwealth principles. Between them they have already destroyed any claim of the Tory Party to provide a responsible and united Opposition, and we need a responsible Opposition in this country. Do not let us get away from it. But some day, when there is time from more urgent work, we will have to ask the Leader of the Opposition where he stands, with Mr. Maudling, Mr. Heath, or Mr. Powell, on all these questions. Because a Party aspiring at some distant day to act as an alternative Government should really have a fairly clear idea of where it stands on such fundamental issues as economic planning, incomes policy and our relations with the Commonwealth.

Thirdly and finally, Mr. Chairman, I want to make clear to the Conference our ideas for increasing Britain’s strength and influence for peace. Next week in Parliament we shall be having a debate on the Washington talks and on wider aspects of foreign affairs. I will not anticipate now the speech I hope to make then if in fact I am successful in catching Mr. Speaker’s eye. I shall, of course, present to the House a full report of our Washington negotiations. Perhaps I had better make one thing clear. There were two conferences in Washington. There was the one that Patrick Gordon-Walker, Denis Healey and I attended and there was the one that I read about in certain sections of the British Press. The House of Commons will, I think, expect me on Wednesday to deal only with the one I attended.

You know, I cannot understand why, since this Government came to power, we have had this long succession of Press stories presented - not just speculation or theorising, and that this may be happening or that Minister may be considering or even rumour about what we have said or done, but stated as a fact and in terms which might lead an innocent reader even to believe the stories to be true. In a period of seven weeks I cannot tell you how many Cabinet meetings I have read about which never even took place, or how at those which did take place we discussed subjects which have never been on the agenda; or how in these discussions which did not take place this or that Minister expressed a particular view on these undiscussed subjects and disagreed violently with another Minister, both having attributed to them views which they do not even hold, on subjects which were not discussed at meetings which had not taken place. Apart from those minor qualifica­tions you can take the stories for the rest as being broadly accurate.

But there is a more serious thing: yesterday a London evening newspaper ran in successive editions as a main headline, as a ‘fact’ - no suggestion of rumour or anything of that sort - a flat story that I had given the President of the United States a secret pledge that we were prepared to participate in a mixed-manned surface fleet. This story is a lie. No such pledge was given. I had myself already stated flatly to the Press, and on television, on my return to this country on Thursday night, before this story ran in the paper concerned, that we had totally reserved our position on this question and yet despite that the editor of that paper on Friday disdained to print the truth and chose to headline the untruth.. It is not for me to remind such editors or journalists - and thank God, they are in a small minority - of their code of conduct in these matters, because there is a code of conduct relating to just this question. All I can say is that we shall not hesitate to state the truth which we know to counter the lies which they print.

Having dealt with that let me now outline to this Conference the principles on which our foreign and defence policies are based, and I say foreign and defence policies because they must proceed in unity. We must not get into the situation again where short-sighted considerations of so-called defence make im­possible a foreign policy which can lead the nations to peace. And, equally, there must be a unity between our defence and our economic policies. What was wrong with the Tory defence policies was not only that they were misdirected but that they did not add up. They were not related to what this country could afford whether in terms of money or in terms of real resources.

Britain’s authority, as we have heard, depends far more on our economic strength and independence than on nostalgia or nuclear pretence. From now on, defence expenditure at home and abroad must be strictly related to what the country can afford. I am glad to say that this realism dominated the approach of every single participant in the recent Chequers Conference on defence policy and dominates the approach of the Government to the preparation of a new realistic and effective defence posture. Equally, I was glad to find that in Washington, President Johnson and his colleagues as well as the British Ministers were concerned to relate defence policies to the economic realities of both our countries. And let this be clear. An approach based on cost-effectiveness, value for money and a hard reappraisal of some of the sacred cows that we have inherited will, so far from weakening the efficacy of our defences, make them stronger and more relevant to Britain’s task in the world.

But turning to the broad lines of our world policy let me say first that we place at the centre of our approach to world problems the strengthening of the United Nations and its ability to keep the peace. Our new Govern­ment has had to live down the suspicion of those who have associated the name of Britain with Suez or with flat defiance of the United Nations at the time of the Katanga crisis or with the anti-internationalist speech of a then Foreign Secretary who went on to become Prime Minister. I believe there is a new realisation in the world today that Her Majesty’s Government believe in the United Nations and will work for the rule of law in world affairs. I believe that our appointment not only as Ambassador to the United Nations, but as a full member of the Govern­ment, for the first time, of Hugh Foot - a great internationalist - is taken by the whole world, and not least by our friends in the Common­wealth, in Asia and in Africa, as a pledge of our sincerity. We have imposed an embargo on the shipment of arms to South Africa - we were obliged to do it - we have had to face the most vicious campaign of opposition and incitement by our opponents, led by the Leader of the Opposition. I believe this decision has been taken as an earnest of our desire to place ourselves again with our Commonwealth colleagues in conformity with the United Nations’ decisions and in a posture of resistance to racialism in all its forms.

But this is not enough. We need to streng­then the peace-keeping powers of the United Nations. We shall co-operate with our friends and allies in any steps that can be taken within the Charter to strengthen those powers, and we shall seek the opportunity wherever it may occur to improve the Charter wherever this is desirable. I believe that in the years immediately ahead of us, the world is presented with an opportunity and a challenge such as we could not perhaps have hoped for even a few years ago - an opportunity of which our fathers, the pioneers of this movement, dreamed - and that is: an opportunity to create a genuine inter­national peace-keeping force powerful enough to bring peace and order out of chaos, powerful enough to stop small wars from escalating into big ones. We, the Government, are hard at work to see that this opportunity is not allowed to pass by and we are prepared to contribute not only ideas but resources to provide a practical British contribution to the peace-keeping forces of the United Nations.

Secondly, we seek to strengthen our alliance. This has been one of the main sub­jects that we have discussed in Washington. Over the past two years, particularly since the Nassau agreement, stresses and strains have developed within the Alliance, and there has been dangerous talk - if not intention - of the development of nuclear status by one or other member of the Alliance. The biggest danger the world faces today, and I put this beyond all other priorities in international affairs, is the danger of the spread of nuclear weapons. Heaven knows Britain under the previous Government never took the opportunity we then had to give a lead in internationalising the bomb. Heaven knows the previous Government, at the very moment when a lead had been given which could have led to an effective ban on nuclear proliferation, was prepared itself to resist that ban, to ignore that lead, and to encourage nuclear separatisms in others. And it is precisely because of this danger to mankind, which rests in the spread of nuclear weapons, that in the vitally import­ant talks in Washington this week, the emphasis was laid by both of us on collectivising NATO’s nuclear power, and above all to do it in such a way as to stop the danger of any more fingers on the nuclear trigger.

If that were all that had come out of our Washington talks - the united and fixed determination of the President of the United States and ourselves to do everything in our power to stop the spread of these horror weapons - that of itself would have provided enough justification for our meeting. But the great theme of our discussions was the fact that we were looking outwards, not inwards, outwards to ensure more effective peace­keeping forces, outward in our determination to seize any opportunity - and if none exists to create one - to put forward new initiatives towards arms control and disarmament. And here again, we have in Britain’s Labour Govern­ment, for the first time a Minister of Dis­armament working full time on the initiatives that Britain will be proposing.

You know we heard a lot at the Election designed to suggest that a Labour Government would not be in on these international discussions - we would not have a ticket. Let me make it clear that within seven weeks of taking office we have not only been partners - and I mean partners - in one of the most important international discussions since the war; we have for the first time for many years tabled a distinctly British initiative for which our friends and allies have been waiting. We shall be there at the Conference table and we shall be wanted as long as we have anything to contribute. The years of sterility are over and we now have a Government ready and able to take initiatives for peace.

And our third objective, Mr. Chairman, is to work with the overwhelming majority of mankind towards the objectives with which mankind is concerned. This is why our membership of the Commonwealth is of such fundamental importance for world peace, and I am glad that our American friends empha­sised, as never before, their recognition of Britain’s world-wide role, their realisation of the importance of Britain in the Common­wealth as a force of peace. In terms of modern economic and military strength, Britain alone can never exert the influence which Britain in the Commonwealth can exert. That is why it has been so important that with our decisions on South Africa our Government quickly and decisively showed its clear deter­mination to rejoin the Commonwealth and to quit our position of abject isolation. This is why by the creation of a Ministry of Overseas Development with a voice in the Cabinet - and a pretty powerful voice at that - we have shown our determination to play our full part in what I described in Washington as the only war we seek - the war against poverty and hunger, illiteracy and disease. This is why too in the great world struggle between those who believe in racial freedom and equality and those who side with their oppressors, the voice of Britain must be unequivocally heard on the side of freedom and equality. In my speech at Scarborough I said:

There is no standing aside, no comforting refuge in abstentions or vetoes, we are either against oppression, or we condone it. In these issues, there can be no neutrals, no escape. For in this shrinking world, while political isolationism invites danger, and economic isolationism invites bankruptcy, moral isolationism invites contempt.

We gave our pledge and as a Government we are fulfilling that pledge. Just as President Johnson fought his campaign on the issue of civil rights and won because of the courage he showed, so we have ranged ourselves clearly against racial incitement, racial dis­crimination and the evil exploitation of racial­ism which still goes on in our own country. For it would be hypocrisy to condemn racialism and colour prejudice and apartheid abroad if we tolerate it in Britain - or in our own Party. There have been those who have criticised my actions at the very outset of this Parliament in making this a major issue of challenge between our two Parties. I do not apologise. The section of the report we are debating relates to the general election. And every delegate here today knows that while the Conservative Leader had finally dragged out of him on television an assertion of the principle of equality in this country, a condemnation of racialism, nevertheless on the doorstep there were Conservatives, to say nothing of their near-Fascist allies, who were prepared to exploit primitive and ignorant passions for the squalid purpose of winning unworthy votes.

Your Labour Government has announced its intention to legislate against racial intoler­ance. Your Labour Prime Minister has challenged the Conservative Leader to come out of his shell and to associate himself with that group of courageous Tories, Sir Edward Boyle and others, who were prepared in the election to lose votes rather than deal in the sordid currency of racialism.

But if we are to condemn, our hands must be clean. And in your name I have condemned and will condemn every so-called Labour Club which operates colour discrimination and every group of misguided workers who try to operate colour prejudice in their working relationships.

‘He hath made of one blood all nations to dwell upon the Earth.’ This Labour Party of ours is more than a political organisation: it is a crusade, or it would be better that it did not exist.

So, Mr. Chairman, I present Conference with our blueprint for the future. It is not the result of feverish activity of seven weeks in office, though there is plenty of that going on. It is the result of patient work in the National Executive, in the Parliamentary Party, in working parties and advisory groups which have employed the long years of opposition to good purpose, even at times when it seemed that we could not see an end to those years: men and women who were prepared to dedicate their abilities, their experience, their enthusiasm, their idealism to building for the future.

But it has been far more than that. The purpose to which we have now set our hand is a distillation of the thinking and the idealism of the democratic traditions of this country over a century past.

It is easy to be a Socialist today. It no longer means victimisation, eviction from one’s home, persecution or worse. But the founders of our Movement, men of courage, men of infinite faith, were prepared to face persecu­tion and even death that a generation still to come might realise their ideals, might be permitted to create that new and just society which their vision could see gleaming above the squalor and exploitation and ugliness of Victorian industrialism. Now, as a result of the faith which they bequeathed to us, as a result of the courage of men and women in this room today, who have kept the flag flying - 33 years ago when our enemies thought this movement of ours was destroyed - as a result of the efforts of everyone in this hall and countless others in these past few months, the day for which we and those that went before us have waited is here. It is our task to be worthy of the torch they have handed on to us.

For we meet today in these exciting first weeks of what is only the second Labour Government to be elected with power. Never in our history has Britain stood so greatly in need of the principles which our faith can generate: rarely in world history has this country been given such an opportunity to give a lead towards peace and disarmament and world brotherhood.

Sustained and inspired by our great people, I give you this pledge: that we shall not fail, that from our endeavours we shall build a fairer, a more just society, that from our faith and. our ideals, we shall contribute our full meed towards creating a world of peace."
10115,"Alex Quaison-Sackey, PGA Inauguration Speech",http://undocs.org/en/A/PV.1332,Alex Quaison-Sackey,President of the General Assembly,Inauguration Speech,1964,,"3. The TEMPORARY PRESIDENT: It is with a deep sense of pleasure and relief that I welcome all representatives present in this Hall. As you are all aware, I assumed the onerous responsibility of guiding the work of the nineteenth session of the General Assembly in at' atmosphere charged with tension, fear and unce:r,~..inty about the very future of QUIt' Organization. Today, thanks to the spirit of s!atesmanship, compromise and magnanimity .displayed by all Member·States,:the way is now clear for the General Assembly to resume its normal functions. It is fitting therefore, that special tribute should be paid to all those who patiently and indefatigably gave their unstinted support and cooperation to me andto the Secretary-General, UThant, during the protracted and difficult negotiations which have yielded this happy result. 4. I have no :..ntention, as the outgoing President, to discuss the work of the twentieth session of the General Assembly. Nevertheless. I should like to recall that the unprecedented crisiS which threatened the survival of the United Nations prevented the nineteenth session from considering some of the burning issues of the world. Thus, we failed to discuss and take decisions on vital problems like disarmament, apartheid and racial discrimination, the representat! on of China and peaceful coexistence among States. The Assembly was also unable to take up the problems of territories that are not yet independent, foremost among which are Southern Rhodesia, Angola, Mozambique, so-called Portuguese Guinea. South West Africa and British Guiana. 5. In spite of this setback. we must concede that the nineteenth session had a few bright spots. The fact that ratification of the amendments to the Charter of the United Nations went through according to schedule should be a matter of gratification to all States Members of the Organization, particularly to .African and Asian members whose legitimate aspirations have been satisfied. This achievement should inspire in us the hope that steps will be taken to convene a conference to reView the Charter as soon as practicable. The timemay not be opportune for further amendments of the Charter, but every effort should be made to strang~henthe Organization as an effective instrument for peace. 6. The successful solutionofthe problemofArticle 19 of the Charter is convincing evidence that there is no dearth o£ statesmanship in the world today. If this can be fully utilized by the United Nations, then we can approach many of the intractable problems of the world with hope and confidence. The ominous cloudswhich hovered over the nineteenth session have been dissipated. and the twentieth session provides a fresh opportunity for a.U to find solutions to the conflicts that are plaguing the world today. The prospects for a fruitful session are encouraging, and I hope that Members -will seize this opportunity of making good the havoc thatthe locusts of dissension have created. 7. We are living in a very uneasy world. Therefore. guided by the moral conscience of the world which must be evident here in this very Assembly, we should bend all our energies to remove the root causes which produce conflicts between man and man. whether black, white or yellow. and between nation and nation. Let the twentieth session. which is a culmination of the International Co-operation Year. herald in an era of peace and harmony.

10116,"Ludwig Erhard, Chancellor Inauguration Speech",https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/commandingheights/shared/minitext/prof_ludwigerhard.html,Ludwig Erhard,Chancellor (Germany),Inauguration Speech,1965,,"Only 17 at the outbreak of World War I, Ludwig Erhard came from modest circumstances in Bavaria. He attended school only to junior secondary level, and then entered a commercial apprenticeship at 16. Inducted into the German army as the war widened, he served as an artilleryman and was seriously wounded in 1918.

Amid the political and economic turmoil that swept Germany in the war's aftermath, Erhard managed to gain entrance to the commercial college at Nuernberg. In 1922 he took up further studies in marketing, management, political economy and sociology at the University of Frankfurt/Main. Even as he did so, hyperinflation was sweeping away the economic security of the middle class and wrecking public confidence in Germany's fledgling republic.

Soon married, Erhard found work as a consumer market researcher for the Institute of Restaurant Economics. As democracy collapsed and the Nazi party established its chokehold on the society, many blamed Germany's ills on external conspiracy and racial pollution. Erhard saw the problem differently. For him the roots of the problem lay in Germany's own authoritarian political heritage.

Under the Nazi regime Erhard maintained a low profile, continuing his work in the consumer sector, but in 1944 he wrote a memo on war financing and debt consolidation which began with the assumption that Germany would lose the war. This memo was passed by the German resistance to the Allies. From that point forward, Erhard was seen as a reliable participant in the postwar effort to rebuild a democratic Germany. In 1947 he was appointed director of the Economic Council for the joint Anglo-U.S. occupation zone.

That he was his own man was proved, however, when he defied allied supreme commander Gen. Lucius Clay in the darkest days of the postwar economic crisis. He abolished price controls at the same moment the Allies introduced a new German currency. This decision, considered by many a disastrous mistake, became instead the foundation of Germany's economic rebirth. The black market disappeared, shortages ended, inflation halted, and the population's strong commercial instincts took hold once again.

In the years ahead, Erhard's decisiveness and conviction that markets could work even in so dark an hour, would provide inspiration to many politicians and economists caught in similar crises in other countries.

In 1949 the Federal Republic of (West) Germany was established, and Erhard joined the Christian Democratic Party. He advocated the views of an economic group known as the Ordoliberals. Opposing a planned economy, the Ordoliberals envisioned what they called a social market economy, combining open market competition with a strong central bank and a social safety net to protect the disadvantaged.

With the Christian Democrats' victory, Konrad Adenauer became chancellor and Erhard was appointed economics minister. For the succeeding 14 years he shepherded the new West German economy through a recovery that outpaced the growth of the European countries that had won the war.

In 1963 Erhard himself became chancellor, but in 1966 his own Cabinet opposed his proposed economic reforms to cope with a budget deficit and recession, and he resigned. Appointed honorary chairman of the Christian Democratic Union the following year, he died in Bonn, West Germany, in 1977."
10120,"Amintore Fanfani, PGA Inauguration Speech",http://undocs.org/en/A/PV.1409,Amintore Fanfani,President of the General Assembly,Inauguration Speech,1965,,"J. The TEMPORARY PRESIDENT (translated from French): Last year the General Assembly met in circumstances that seemed highly auspicious to us all. Just when the work of the twentieth session was beginning, the efforts of numerous States and of the Organization enabled two Member States to bring to an end bitter fighting which threatened to degenerate into a broader conflict. The armistice was subsequently carried a step further at an important meeting arranged by a permanent member of the Security Council. 4. This year we begin our work at a time when, despite the suspension of bombings after the twentieth session was adjourned, and despite subsequent demarches ,and efforts, another conflict rages on, sowing anxiety, misery and sorrow. 5. As the twenty-first session opens, we find ourselves fervently hoping that by the time our work has been completed we may see positive signs of peace on the horizon and catch a glimpse of that moment, so intensely desired, when constructive negotiations are begun with a view to a settlement which will be honourable for all concerned-and will enable the Viet-Namese to live peacefully in calm and prosperity, as a free and independent people. 6. Even if the United Nations as such cannot at this time have a direct influence on the settlement of this conflict; no country or individual participating in the activities of this great family of nations must refrain from helping in the search for a peaceful solution. 7. On 4 October 1965, during a meeting outstanding among all those of the twentieth session [1347th meeting], we all applauded a most distinguished guest, who came from Rome to address to usthe exhortation repeated again yesterday: ""Never again war!"" In keeping with the acclaim we accorded that exhortation a year ago, it is our duty to persevere unceasingly to explore the path to peace-for peace is absolutely essential to the freedom, progress and well-being of all mankind. 8. During the session opening today, you will have to examine-under difficult circumstances, considering the present international outlook--a number of problems which must be solved ifthe United Nations is to function effectively
9. Before we broke up on 22 December last year, we Teached by common accord certain decisions which seemed favourable to the solution of those problems. Unfortunately, the intervening period has not been long enough to enable all the results hoped for to be achieved. And since the success has been only partial, there is a danger that the difficulties which appear to be partly responsible for the Secretary-General's decision not to make himself available for a second term of office may continue and grow worse. 10. Our recognition of the services which U Thant has rendered, $5 all agree, with dedication and Inte grlty, to the United Nations and the cause of peace, has prompted us all to express to him in our very different ways-our confidence and gratitude. The expressions of solidarity and appreciation-a veritable plebiscite-from small and great nations alike, irre spective of their leanings of politica] allegiance, bear witness to the way in which In cártying out his duties he has succeeded in rising above all controversies, thereby earning universal respect. It would thus seem fair to say that, in view of the difficulties we face today, Secretary-General U Thant would help to dispel our fears if he would agree either to carry on his work, as we all hope, On=and I suggest this alternative only because I am called upon to do so to offer his assistance to the competent organs of the United Nations and so help them to take the most Appropriate decisions. 11. Aside from this difficulty which has arisen on the eve of the present session, and which we hope to overcome in accordance with the wishes I have just expressed, we are all bound in duty to redouble our efforts to solve the problems relating to the resources, activities and authority of the United Nations, 
12. First, we must solve the problem of the financial situation of the United Nations. To this end, at the last session we set up the Committee of Fourteen/ which has duly carried out its task. It is now a matter of urgency for its recommendations, and any amend ments which may be made to them, to be translated Into decisions of the General Assembly. These deci sions will no doubt help to simplify and rationalize the administrative structure and operational methods of the United Nations. In addition, by enabling those Member States which have not as yet announced voluntary contributions to do so, they will help to eliminate the final obstacles to the task of putting the finances of the Organization in order. 13. The second fundamental requirement, which Involves us all, is that the Organization should have well-defined rules on which it can base its action in fulfilling its peace-keeping responsibilities. Unfor tunately, the efforts of the Committee of Thirty-three / have hardly been encouraging. During its twenty-first session, the Assembly should therefore study the problem again closely, so that the Organization may become a reliable and efficient Instrument in this Arei. 14. The third and final requirement is that the nu thority of the United Nations should extend to all parts 
of the world, leaving no region where its influence Is not felt. This will be possible, however, only I wa have the wisdom and sense of responsibility expected of us and achieve-without departing from the prin ciples of the Organization-the true universality envisaged by those who drew up the Charter of the United Nations. 15. I have indicated three problems which will be difficult to solve. However, this difficulty does not mean we may overlook them. 
16. In 1945, Beardsley Ruml predicted: ""It will only 
... we will know that the [Organization is the only alternative to the demolition of the world. 3/ Since this prediction has come true, all that remains is to find a proper solution to the problems plaguing the United Nations. If we struggle now to wurd off the apocalyptic destruction of the world, we are in lact fighting to ensure for thc Organization sufficient funds, effective action and universal authority. 17. Once we have confronted and solved the three basic problems just outHned, we shall have laid the foundations for a stronger and more etrective United Nations. But we shall not have created the climate best sulted to the balanced economic and social de velopment of all mankind. Yet this lg Indispensable if new sources of social conflict ane to be avoided and WAT prevented. 18. We have already reached the hallway point in the United Nations Development Decade. If we psesc briefly to take stock at this stage, we find that the situation is far from satisfactory, despite the miny efforts made-though admittedly they have been poorly co-ordinated at times. The flow of funds intended for developing natione has increased, but not in proportion to the need. The terms on which financial aid is granted are still too heavy ind the rate at which the effect is felt is discouragingly alow. Exchange rates are still unfavourable for the developing countries, and the United Nations has not yet succeeded in getting the necessity corrective measures adopted, even in respect of those essentiel commodities for which an agreement seemed near at hand. Under such circum stances, the debts of developing nations are increasing alarmingly, and the technical, economic and soc!) Gulf between these metlone and the Industrialized countries continues to widen. 19. The experience acquired up to now would suggest Fore co-ordination and simpler procedures. Perhaps, too, we should devote particular attention to technicul co-operation which, as was indicated in a recent proposal by a European nation, is indispensable 1 the development of the different countries is to proceed smoothly and the gap between them is not to widen until the situation is beyond control. 
20. This predicament appears less ominous when we consider that the principles of economic co operation espoused by the United Nations are steadily gaining greater ncceptance. No one today challenges the fact that the problem of under-developenent affecte 
all nations, whether industrialized or not. Everyone recognizes that moral, political and economic factors make the mobilization of the energies and resources of every country to combat the soounge of under development justifiable and indeed mandatory. Let us hope that this agreement on principles may prove the first stage in a review of our course of action, ånd that this review may in turn lead to the rationalization and greater yield and efficiency of the work already begun. 
21. The agenda of the twenty-first session of the Assembly encompasses, 49 usual, a wide range of questions involving international co-operation. Without atopping to analyse this agenda, I wish to stress that We trust devote special attention again this year to the problems of disarmament and particularly to those where a solution will lead to the conclusion of an agreement to halt the proliferation of nuclear weapons. This is no easy task and it must be accomplished with the utmost urgency, before new developments looming up at this very moment render any solution impossible, 
22. The constructive debates held at Geneva, and later in New York, appear to be leading rapidly towards the adoption of a draft agreement on outer space. This agréement will extend the principles of international law and of the Charter of the United Nations and the ban on nuclear devices and weapons of mass destruction beyond the boundaries of the earth's atmosphere. We may thus look forward with a measure of optimism to the possibility. pursued with such tenacity, of an agreement to halt the spread of buclear weapons. 
23. During the present session, the decolonization fosue will prove particularly urgent and delicate. There are few problems dealt with in the United Nations that are so intimately bound up with the very nature of the Organization as those involving the evolution 
-and especially the political evolution of Non-Self Governing Territories. Impressive though the results achieved in this sensitive and critical arda may be to date, we cannot consider our task completed. Certain problems, for whiob fio solution is as yet in sight, remain a source of tension and frustration in inter national relations. There are particularly complex ones in various regions of sub-equatorial Africa, where a very serious situation has been created by the spread of discriminatory doctrines and practices Incompatible with respect for human dignity. In examining these problems, the Assembly should make clear fire and foremost its resolve to establish In every Non-Self-Governing Territory, 46 elsewhere, the necessary conditions for the affirmation of human dignity, in an atmosphere completely free from dis crimination, apartheld and arbitrary action consistent with the degree of maturity which the human race hea attained. 
24. The mere mention of these formidable and delicate problems facing us gives cogency to the hope I would like to share with you: may the twenty-first session prove universally beneficial. This hope applies to all here present, and to our reapeotive countries, Mom, bers of the Organization; and it applies 4s well to those peoples which do not yet enjoy independence And freedom. 
25. May God hallow this wish; may the represen tatives gathered here fulfil it; and may all mankind reap Its plentiful benefits.

10121,"Kurt Georg Kiesinger, Chancellor Inauguration Speech",https://www.britannica.com/biography/Kurt-Georg-Kiesinger,Kurt Georg Kiesinger,Chancellor (Germany),Inauguration Speech,1966,,"Kurt Georg Kiesinger, (born April 6, 1904, Ebingen, Germany—died March 9, 1988, Tübingen, West Germany), conservative politician and chancellor (1966–69) of the Federal Republic of Germany whose “grand coalition” brought the Social Democratic Party (SPD) into the government for the first time since 1930.
Kiesinger was educated at Berlin and Tübingen, after which he began to practice law. He joined the Nazi Party after Adolf Hitler’s accession to power in 1933 but remained largely inactive in it and refused to join the National Socialist lawyers’ guild in 1938. During World War II he served as assistant chief of the radio propaganda department in the foreign ministry. Interned by U.S. forces after the war, Kiesinger was finally cleared by Allied and German denazification courts. He joined Konrad Adenauer’s Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and began his parliamentary career in the newly formed Federal Republic of Germany (1949). From 1949 to 1958 he was a member of the Bundestag (federal lower house), where he served as chairman of the foreign policy committee and defended Adenauer’s pro-Western foreign policy as well as his conservative domestic course. From 1958 to 1966 he was minister-president of Baden-Württemberg and from 1962 to 1963 Bundesrat (federal upper house) president.
Kiesinger replaced Ludwig Erhard as chancellor on December 1, 1966, after the latter had lost the support of the CDU’s coalition partner in the government, the Free Democratic Party (FDP). Kiesinger was able to deflect hostile publicity about his former membership in the Nazi Party. His government, a grand coalition between the CDU and the SPD, remained in power for nearly three years, during which time the West German economy improved after it had begun to falter under Erhard. Kiesinger continued a pro-Western foreign policy but to some degree eased tensions with the Soviet bloc. His party fared well in the 1969 election, but the SPD formed a coalition with the FDP. On October 20, 1969, Kiesinger was replaced as chancellor by Willy Brandt of the SPD."
10125,"Abdul Rahman Pazhwak, PGA Inauguration Speech",http://undocs.org/en/A/PV.1560,Abdul Rahman Pazhwak,President of the General Assembly,Inauguration Speech,1966,,"3. The TEMPORARY PRESIDENT: As we convene in this, our twenty-second session, many of us may conclude that a most striking feature of the General Assembly is that it has met in three separate sessions within the narrow compass of the past twelve months. Thus the Assembly has been in a state of nearly continuous deliberation. This development, if continued, may well mark the evolution of this world body into a virtual year-round parliament of nations. 4. A parallel and striking aspect of the period. spanning the three sessions is that it has been marked by increased tensions among nations and by a lamentable deterioration in the general world political situation. This is a fact which has been noted in the highest circles of government everywhere. It is a fact which has been deplored by all peoples, particularly the peoples of the United Nations who have vested responsibility in this Organization forfundamentalissues affecting their lives and their destinies. 5. What relevance do our greatly extended deliberations have to the crises confronting these peoples? For me, who bore the responsibility of presiding over all of the three preceding sessionst some response to this searching question is not only a courtesy but a duty, Therefore, it is this period that I now propose to examine, so that we may briefly consider together the lessons which these still fresh pages of history hold for us. 6. The decisions of the twenty-first regular session are well known. A number of negative developments came upon the world thereafter, but a close examination will show that they had not escaped the Assembly's concern. Nor did the Assembly, in all of its ramifications, fail to anticipate them with important decisions where these were pOSSible, while shOWing alertness to the distress signals which foreshadowed those developments. 7. Here we might emphasize a positive aspect of this world body generally overlooked by commentators-its supreme value as an agency of political meteorology. giving warning to peoples and Governments of the dangers ahead. In looking back on the history of wars and the seismic surprise of their eruptions, we see that one of the significant contributions the Assembly makes is to run up the distress signals on political storms brewing beyond the horizon. Those signals are to be found especially in the preambles to resolutions, in open policy statements and in extensive committee debates. The Assembly book of records is a chronicle of dire prophecies which time has-almost invariably and always unhappily-borne out. Few, if any, calamities in our time have befallen the world without some advance notice in the collective utterance from this rostrum. 8. Thus, if fools and folly rule the world, the end of man in our time may come as a rude shock, but it will no longer come as a complete surprise. The warnings given are there. 9. The failure of Governments to heed them is another matter. ThiS is often and wrongly referred to as ""the shortcoming of the United Nations"". It would be more accurate to state that it is the shortcoming of Governments which have failed to being the deUb.erations of this supreme organ to their peoples. It is time to sayand to say if frankly-that the duty of all leaders is to assume a full comprehension by their peoples of the decisions and resolutions of the world Organization and to take concrete a.ction for their implementation. The implementation of the principles supported by the majority of the Members should be the foremost concern of the entire membership. 10. There exists a great and dangerous difference between the sincere and honest aspirations of the peoples of the world everywhere and the policies which determine their fate. The moral obligation for achieving a better world cannot be a one-way street without coming to a fatal dead-end. The struggle for peace, so crucial in our time, will be a lost battle until it is based on the aspirations of the peoples of the world, who seek only peace, 11, I turn now to the seven weeks of the fifth special session, held from 21 April to 13 June 1967. The Assembly took an historic deciSion involving the ultimate rights of a free Africa, for we are aware that the full and complete freedom of Africa is long-too longoverdue. 12. That session dealt also with the constitutional crisis involVing the structure of peace-keeping and its financial aspect, a problem which threatened with paralysis the very functioning of this body. That problem is still unresolved, and many difficulties must be overcome before a solution can be attained. However, the Assembly manifested the strength to throw back the threat of paralysis, to recover its balance and to remove the issue from dangerous confrontation and to submit it to a procedure of systematic negotiation in appropriate forums. We should not fail to persevere in the important quest for agreement with all the urgency that the problem deserves. 13. In the fifth emergency special session, which opened on 17 June to deal With the war in the Middle East and which we adjourned yesterday I the spectre of internal division again beset the General Assembly, this time simultaneously with division in the Security Council, In that double rift, the United Nations found itself under a dark cloud of profound and universal dejection, 14, The failure of the General Assembly to reach accord On a formula is, of course, be be deplored. On the other hand, time has dispelled the cloud of disappointment to some extent. The United Nations lost a battle, but it stopped a war. Nor isthat an insignificant achievement in circumstances where the flames of conflict threatened an entire region and from the very start involved the danger of a Big Power confrontation. 15. The session reached a high level of una.nimity on the question of Jerusalem and on the interests of both the old and the new refugees. And while it failed to .. reach an accord on the general principles for a full solution, it is nCJW evident that it has gone a long way. towards clarifying the thorny issues and that, for all the parties directly and indirectly involved, it has set a more realistic focus of what is possible and what is unattainable. Thus the session has laid the foundations for another effort in the pursuit of just and reasonable solutions in the months ahead. 16. The emergency special session has called upon the twenty-second regular session to inscribe that unfinished business on its agenda; moreover, to give it the highest priority in our deliberations, The peace of an entire region is involved-a region which is perhaps the world's most strategic area, And the world will expect the United Nations, moving forward from the progress made, to come firmly and resolutely to grips with the crucial problems involved and work with single-minded determination for maximum results that will not only discourage the recurrence of war but lay down the basic principles of a viable procedure for a just and honourable peace. 17. In a broader and historic sense, that episode has demonstrated that the United Nations, in the face of dangerous divisionism, could reveal its inherent strength and its ability to cope with the most acute crisis of sudden war. 18. The Middle East crisis struck quickly, but it did not explode in a vacuum. If we place it in the context of a larger world picture, we shall see that it is not unrelated to the malevolent forces of violence that have gripped the world in the pa.st year. In many areas and on many levels the psychology of force has swept the minds of men and nations, and where once the virtues of peace were extolled today the efficacy of force is openly flaunted and even exalted. 19. What has produced this climate? One cause is frustration, the frustration that comes from protracted truce and the unfinished business of finished war; and from a bellicose approach to the making of peace itself. The Middle East episode is only one demonstration of the paradox that pursuit of peace in the wrong way is itself sometimes fraught with the dangers of another war, Like justice, peace delayed is peace denied, and time is no healer where there is pathological tampering with the peace process. 20. During the past twelve months we have seen another aspect of this problem on the other side of the world in the alarming war in Viet-Nam, It is a conflict that has evaded every peace effort and its violence is escalating in both scope and intensity. Positions are irrationally hardening in a struggle that has brought military leaders to a situation of stalemate. ParadOXically, a dead-end has been reached, yet men insist that they must go on and on along the same futile path. On both sides frayed nerves are moving to neurOSis, and there is danger that when frustrations reach a breaking-point the parties will seek·away out in further enlargement of the struggle, reaching dimensions they themselves cannot predict. A depressing aspect of the conflict is that veteran statesmen, fully conversant with international procedures, are unable to find an acceptable formula-acceptable, that is, to both sides, 21. We may now ask: is not the greatest danger in the Middle East and in Viet-Nam the fact that the parties are losing control of the run-away forces of war?
Here is an appalling possibility when we consider that the decisive factors in the conflict are primarily the big Powers, which are vested with the main responsibility for the safeguarding of world peace. 22. There is also a third war-the colonial war in Africa, the almost forgotten war, we might call it. This, the Middle East and Viet-Nam all have the familiar features of the colonial type struggle, 23. But now we see the rise of new species of violence-some of which, we may frankly note, were not always taken into account by the major premises of past United Nations decisions. The continued application of force and the threat of force against people and political parties in areas marked by the United Nations for decolonization are more dangerous than ever in our world of closely related politics, but they are familiar maladies and we have had some experience in dealing with them. 24. Less evident and more deceptive are the lastditch colonial and pro-colonial forces surreptitiously entering into phantom coalitions in preparation for a new struggle against the Charter itself, a struggle which threatens in Africa to degenerate into the ugliest kind of war imaginable, a raCial war. 25, Against this persistent rallying of force, we see the rise of desperate and more determined resistance movements already forming themselves into guerrilla armies in many parts of the world. These movements reflect a sharp response to external interventionuninvited or invited-or to failure of certain Powers to comply promptly with United Nations decisions, time-tables and principles for de colonization. In both cases they are symptoms rather than causes. 26. To be sure, such guerrilla forces are still in the formative stages, but we need look no further than Viet-Nam to see how far such forces can expand and how inevitably they become the focal points of intervention by big Powers. They might well become the Viet-Nams of tomorrow, and we can only ponder how a world so badly shaken by one Viet-Nam could bear the shock of a number of such conflicts. The United Nations is expected to be able to avert the rise of this expanding type of warfare by dealing decisively with its root causes. 27. Another new species of war is the insidious use of mercenary forces to invade foreign lands. These illegitimate armies without flags and without government backing, may, if they continue to develop as a feature of the modern powerstruggle, add the spectacle of thirteenth century piracy and marauding to mock the Age of Reason. The great danger for us is that these faceless forces evade the peace procedures governing international relations and erode the narrow beachheads of international law so painstakingly established. We must scotch this movement in its infancy as a new force for chaos in our time. 28. Nor can one overlook the erosion ofthose aspects of international law built upon respect for the practices and decencies of diplomatic exchange. This deterioration-for which all Governments must answer and from which all will suffer and none can gain-serves only to aggravate disrespect for the norms of diplomacy, for the rights of the individual and, eventually and inevitably, for the sanctity of law 29. In other areas we see the sudden and mysterious rise of animosities and incidents between small nations. Sometimes these incidents are the result of natural claims and conflicts but recently they are suggestive of the invisible hand of outside powers, 30. Two unhappy consequences follow from such policies: United Nations programmesfor the reduction of armaments are undermined by stimulation of a new kind of arms race-the race to supply countries, mostly the smaller ones, not presently engaged in war or in a state of war, with armaments not so much for purposes of national security as for rivalry with other small nations in an opposite power orbit; and in consequence, new suspicions, new fears, new tensions are generated, with new threats to the entire structure of world peace and security. The pursuit of such policies strengthens the bypassing and even defiance of the United Nations, whose accumulated decisions are found burdensome, This growing tendency by certain States should be pointed out frankly. Can Member States truly ignore the United Nations, challenge its authority, and even undermine its accumulated prestige without such policies seriously reflecting on their own prestige? 31, What are the forces behind these new and disturbing manifestations? The cold war, we are told, is dead, but apparently its death has been somewhat exaggerated. To be sure, the cold war in the form of a nuclear confrontation and aggressive alliances has greatly thawed, and this marks important progress, But now we see a resurgence of rivalry in the more indirect forms of interventionism and in all manner of anti-Charter sophistry. We may appropriately ask: Has the cold war gone underground? Has it shifted from the big bombs to the small ~ations? 32. If this is so, then the world faces a new type of power struggle, this one without even the moral justification of an ideological crusade. The parties themselves have time and again disavowed the pursuit of policies based on ideologies, and this is happily evident in Europe and to some extent between the two giant Powers. Therefore, what can the new struggle portend, but a striving for power-not for principle, but for power itself, raw, naked power, rooted in purely selfish, national interests, and tactically translated into actions that play havoc with the delicate structure of world peace. 33. More dangerous is the fact that this new rivalry goes on behind the fagade of so-called coexistence. Of course, we can only welcome every step that furthers a climate of coexistence among the Powers, but this should not be limited to the big Powersj it should not become their monopoly and their sole blessing; it should not be to the exolusion of the smaller nations-and certainly not at their expense. In its quintessence, coexistence, like peace, should be indivisible. Some will have certain reservations regarding this analysis, but one thing is sure. New political forces are at play in the world-forces which did not exist when most of the pastmajor decisions of this Assembly were taken on the burning issues of war and peace in our time. 34. Perhaps the time has come when we might reexamine some of our formulations in the light of these new developments. We must reaffirm not only first-and perhaps forgotten-principles, but we must give them new concepts of implementation. We will have to refocus our vision on new horizons, to apply new remedies for new maladies and to meet new expectations With new hopes. 35. In short, we shall be called upon to accord recognition to what is now obvious: that ours is a world of seething change, revolutionary change, but that these mutations themselves are not always evident. In such a dynamic world all elements, political and economic, are in a perpetual state of transition. and only one factor remains fixed: our goal for world peace; our steadfast determination to attain that goal. And this undying hope we shall never abandon.

10128,"Corneliu Manescu, PGA Inauguration Speech",http://undocs.org/en/A/PV.1674,Corneliu Manescu,President of the General Assembly,Inauguration Speech,1967,,"3. The TEMPORARY PRESIDENT (translated from French): Gentlemen, the opening of a new session of the General Assembly has always been an occasion which invites reflections on the current status of international relations and on the problems confronting our Organization. 
4. At its twenty-second session, which completed its work yesterday, the General Assembly decided-for the first time-to entrust the Presidency of this lofty forum to a country belonging to the socialist community, Romania. The delegations of Member States were all agreed in recognizing that the significance of this choice went beyond mere respect for the principle of the rotation of the Presidency. It was, in fact, an expression of the need for all countries, regardless of the geograpllical region to which they belong or their social or political system, to participate on an equal footing in the functioning of the United Nations and in the direction of its activities by bringing to it the particular contribution of their personality. At the same time it was a recognition of the role played by the socialist countries at the world level and in the work of the Organization.
S. The socialist States have taken the initiative on many occasions in the United Nations and have put forward more than one idea which now forms the basis of important achievements by the United Nations. The participation of the socialist countries in actions aimed at eliminating the colonial system, at bringing about a successful conclusion to the negotiations on disarmament and at promoting the principles of international ecoIlomic co-operation, to men· tion only a few examples, has substantially expanded and strengthened the work of the Organization, while increasing its links with the processes of the contemporary world. Romania steadfastly adheres to the idea of building a society capable of ensuring the full utilization of the talents and energ.ies of the people and the many-sided development of the human personality 1 an idea in which it firmly believes and to the triumph of which it unceasingly devotes its energies, and it is in this same spirit that Romania works within the United Nations.
6. It has been all the easier for me scrupulously to observe the rules of this Organization because the principles of socialist Romania's foreign policy, which have constantly guided me, are in perfect accord with the Charter of the United Nations.
7. If a large number of resoll!tions dealing with problems of peace and security, the development of economic, industrial, technical and scientific relations, the elimination of colonialism and social and humanitarian questions could be adopted by consensus during the twenty-second session, this was due to the consistent use of the working methods indicated by the Charter and to joint actions undertaken in a spirit of understanding and complete equality of rights.
8. What is essential in the joint search for solutions to the problems which concern us is that there should be mutual respect, that arguments should be weighed with complete objectivity and in good faith, and that positive results should be steadfastly pursued
9. I believe that it is precisely owing to the joint efforts of States and to the fact that certain proposals to improve its terms were taken into consideration that it was possible to draw up the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons as a first step on the road to disarmament and a starting-point towards eliminating the danger of war and, first and foremost, the danger of nuclear war. 10. Decisive progress in strengthening the security of all countries cannot be envisaged unless an end is put to the growing arms race, and particularly to the nuclear arms race. It requires the systematic continuation of efforts to achieve effective disarmament measures and the prohibition and elimination of atomic weapons. Having become a condition for the survival of mankind, disannament is a goal towards which the efforts of all States should be directed.
11. We are witnessing an historic process the evolution of which is marked by the vigorous affirmation of the desire of the peoples to forge for themselves a life of freedom and dignity, capable of promoting their economic and social progress in accordance with their own aspirations. After the Second World War, the configuration of the world was radically changed as a result of the accession to political independence of an impressive number of nations. These transformations have a significance which goes beyond mere changes in the political map of the world. As a result of the objective process of the liberation of the peoples from colonial domination and the affirmation of States which have acquired their independence, the international community benefits from the participation of new voices in the debate on the major problems which now concern mankind, and the effectiveness and authority of the solutions adopted are thereby at the same time increased. 
12. Of course, the long colonial domination has left behind it many after-effects which weigh heavily upon the present international situation
13. Among these, the phenomenon of underdevelopment, which affects many countries and areas in various continents, occupies a special place. Underdevelopment-that is, the condition in which large groups of human beings are deprived of the benefits and advantages of world science and technology-appears all the more poignant because the gap between the developing countries and the economically advanced countries has a tendency to increase, quantitatively as well as qualitatively. 14. What has so far been accomplished in this extremely important field is still not enough. The United Nations must show much greater concern-and this is a particularly urgent task required of it-for supporting the efforts undertaken in the economic and social sphere by the developing States themselves
15. The solution of this crucial problem, which is closely linked to the material existence of the peoples and their fundamental aspirations to enjoy decent living conditions, would be considerably facilitated by the elimination ofthe sources of tension which persist in various regions of the globe. 16. Apart from the moral stigma which attaches to them and the suffering which they entail, crises and conflicts insatiably consume valuable resources which would be devoted to progress and well-being. 17. Peace is indivisible; the duty of safeguarding and consolidating it is universal. 18. The existence of conflicts such as those in Viet-Nam and the Middle East has shown how dangerous is the persistence of hotbeds oftension which, in their turn, breed new dangers for mankind. 19. In order to promote the establishment of an atmosphere of trust and understanding which will free mankind from the perils and disastrous consequences of war, it is more than ever necessary that the actions of all States and all Governments should be united in a common effort. 20. For our part, we are convinced that, however complex and difficult these problems may be, the international community has a duty to work unremittingly in the search for lasting and equitable solutions that would ensure a peaceful course in relations between States. What seems to us essential is continuity of effort. The international easing of tension, which is indispensable for the organization of a lasting peace in the world, involves an untiring search for areas of general interest and ways that would make it possible to develop peaceful co-operation between nations by the concerted action of all States, large and small, in conditions of equality, on the basis of respect for the personality and dignity of each nation and by taking into consideration the interests of each people.
21. A year ago, at the opening of the twenty-second session [1560th meeting}, I ventured to point out that our Organization and the work which is being carried out in it represent a stage in the endless struggle through which mankind is trying to eliminate force and destruction from international life and to replace them by standards of rational conduct and peaceful coexistence. 22. At the end of that session, the work which we have accomplished together shows once again what laborious and constan t efforts are reqUired to build and to reinforce the edifice of international legality. 23. It is an objective necessity that makes indispensable in relations between States respect for the principles enshrined in the Charter, namely, independence and national sovereignty, equality of rights and non-interference in domestic affairs. These prinCiples are basic essentials which embody the desire of the peoples that law and mutual trust should preVail in international life. They are also the frame on which it is possible, in our age, to build lasting relations, marked by mutual esteem, between all States. 24. The twenty-three years of work of the United Nations bear witness to the fact that, when these principles have been respected and sustained efforts have been made to promote co-operation among nations through the active contribution of each and of all, the Organization has achieved significant results. The strengthening of the United Nations and the increase in its effectiveness are in direct proportion to the action taken by all Member States to achieve the purpose for which the Organization was established, namely, that of harmonizing the efforts of all countries to eliminate war from international life and to wipe ou t anachronisms which are incompatible with the major imperatives of this century. 25. In order to reach the goals proclaimed in the Charter, faith in progress and in the irreversible advance of mankind towards civilization must be kept alive, and firmness and perseverance must be displayed in removing the obstacles which hinder the normal course of international relations. It is our duty, the duty of every Member State, large or small, to act together to impart to the United Nations the vigour which it needs in order effectively to fill its proper role in bringing about an easing ofinternational tension and the development of co-operation among nations. 26. If the United Nations is to be able to promote lasting solutions, it is particularly important to perceive and appraise with clear-sightedness the Organization's shortcomings which prevent it from fully accomplishing its task, and to take resolute action to eliminate them. Our Organization must provide a framework in which all the States of the world, irrespective of social system or philosophical ideas, make a direct contribution to the normalization of international Hfe. The fact that the lawful rights in the United Nations of the People's Republic of China, whose place and role in international life are unquestionable, have so far not been restored, and the further fact that a number of other States are kept out of the Organization, affect the work of the United Nations by depriVing it of the active support of the peoples of those countries. We are convinced that it is in the interest of the United Nations, and of increasing its effectiveness and its prestige in the world, to ensure in the first place its universality based on the realities of the modern world
27. In conclusion, I would ask you to allow me to express, on this occasion, my warmest thanks to the group of Eastern European States which nominated Romania to the Presidency of the twenty-second session of the General Assembly. 28. At the same time I should like to thank most cordially the States of the other geographical groups for the spirit of co-operation they have displayed, thus facilitating the performance of the duties entrusted to me. 29. I wish to express my deep gratitude to all the representatives for the efforts they have made to give constructive consideration to the problems of the twentysecond session of the General Assembly and to find appropriate solutions. The summarized expression of these efforts lies in the resolutions adopted during the session, the value of which, as in other instances, truly reflects the extent of the work devoted to their elaboration. 30. In appraising these activities, one cannot overlook the skilful assistance of those who, working together in an unobtrusive way, have perfonned a variety of tasks here at the United Nations, and who call see their efforts reflected in each of the results which have been obtained. 31. I should like to express once again my feelings of highest consideration for the Secretary-General U Thant, whose ability, spirit of understanding and straightfOlward· ness we have had occasion to admire throughout our work at the United Nations. 32. The session which we have opened today is called upon to continue the actions so far taken by the United Nations to strengthen the ideas of peace and justice in the world and to mark a further milestone on the road towards the creation of an international climate in which the resources of all States can be mobilized for the purposes of creative activity in the service of man and of the advancement of human society. 33. Romania, which participates with confidence and interest in the work of the United Nations, will continue, so far as its means allow and on the basis of the principles on which it has founded its foreign policy, to support the United Nations, in the belief that the Organization has an increased role to play in accomplishing the noble task of developing co·operation among nations and building a world of peace and confidence among States

10135,"Emilio Arenales Catalán, PGA Closing Speech",http://undocs.org/en/A/PV.1752,Emilio Arenales Catalán,President of the General Assembly,Inauguration Speech,1968,,"The PRESIDENT (translated from Spanish): This ~tQ!osing address will not be a speech, but merely a few final ~i~ords to mark the end of a session which, for various ~'~easons, has been unique and has proved a surprise to many Izpeople
476. I am not going to enumerate the resolutions and ~\~feeches, or try to classify them. Likewise, I shall not ~I!~pdertake to point out which items have been the most tihnportant. It often happens that the major topics are not ipn our agenda, or are not considered by us, usually for valid ~ireasons. Without being on our agenda, the question of 1!:Viet-Nam has occupied a prominent place in the general i~l)~ebates, since it is inconceivable that the largest war of our ~f:d~y should not be a subject of concern to an Organization 1!1Mhich was set up precisely to prevent war.
The problem of the Middle East, which has been ~~Qqnstantly before the United Nations since 1948, has not ~%Yet been solved for reasons which are not always discussed lliere. There are other matters which have not even come ,!·tl ,before the General Assembly, as they were, if not solved at ~lleast ventilated and deflated in the Security Council 0; in Ifclirect negotiations; the problem of the Pueblo, which, Iffor a time, looked as if it might lead to a breach of the ~*peace on other world fronts, becameless inflamatory when t~\lbmitted to the Security Council. The humanitarian ijproblem in Nigeria has not come before the General Assembly. But our gratitude should go out to the International Committee of the Red Cross, the United Nations Chidren's Fund, the representative of the Secretary-General and to all those Governments, institutions and individuals that have so generously concerned themselves with the situation in Nigeria.
478. I shall refrain from commenting on a number of other questions wltich migllt have been raised at this twenty·third session of the General Assembly, as it would not be germane to our purpose. What is needed, however, is a brief evaluation of the general features of the session. 479. Possibly the most important of these, there being no items of paramount world interest, has been the illness of your President. This was a personal matter, but it undoubtedly affected our work, and it was certainly one of the reasons, if not the only one, why this session was unable to fulfil altogether the hope expressed in my opening address that this Assembly might be one of stock-taking and rectification. 480. However, as the Secretary-General so aptly pointed out at the last weekly lunch of the President of the Assembly, for the Vice-Presidents and Committee Chairman, it is perhaps a session at which there has been less acrimony, in other words, rather less cold war. This is the only explanation of the fact that the agenda for our session was adopted and allocated at a single meeting of the General Committee, except for two minor items that were easy to discuss and negotiate.
481. What is the reason for the peaceful atmosphere of the twenty-third session of the General Assembly? Is it a good or a bad sign? I think that the great international problems, with the pOSSible exception of the Middle East, development, peaceful co-existence and a few others, were left off our agenda for understandable and possibly justifiable reasons. While it may seem extraordinary that Viet-Nam should not have been put on the United Nations agenda, it would have been extremely awkward if the question had been discussed in all its delicate ramifications while peace negotiations were being held in Paris and an election campaign conducted in the United States. The question of the Middle East, which, although on our agenda, was not the subject of any substantive resolutions, has been practically exhausted here. Let us not forget, moreover, that the Security Council is almost constantly concerned with it, and that we cannot and must not interfere with the Council's jurisdiction or that of the Jarring Mission. 482. So far as the question of Czechoslovakia is concerned, there seems to have been a tacit understanding between East and West not to embark upon a futile cold war debate. Neither side can have felt unconcerned about the question of foreign intervention, perhaps because, as someone put it, it is very easy to begin a cold war but not too easy to stop it.
483. To sum up, apart from a few other important aspects which need not be mentioned here, I think that the most striking feature I have again observed during this Assembly and which is one of the shortcomings of the United Nations, is the unrealistic and rather emotional approach of a great many representatives. Unrealistic, because regrettably one cannot daily to perceive how often the delegations or representatives expend all their skill and diplomacy on producing a resolution on each topic, regardless of the fact that the ills of this world are not cured simply by the adoption of resolutions but by the action of Governments, and emotional because emotion is often placed before reason, irrespective of the consequences for the Organization and the world.
484. Many Member States may not yet have experienced the scepticism or disillusionment felt in other countries and at other levels. The truth is that we who come to the United Nations year after year fall prey to such illusions more readily than countries which are perhaps more advanced, with civil services that are more experienced or have a longer tradition, and are realistic enough to avoid them. The worst in this respect are those who spend their whole time at international conferences, They are so involved with their own immediate parliamentary problems that they fail to realize that the solution lies close to them in the hands of our own Governments. What we need at times is not more speeches and resolutions, but more good faith and the political will to settle problems directly. Without that will and good faith, it will be very difficult to solve those very problems which inspire the resolutions and the speeches.
485. The mission of our Organization will not be fulfilled solely by the adoption of resolutions, however important they may be. There is an essential counterpart to this, namely the fulfilment of the Organization's objectives by the Government's which constitute the international community.
486. This brings me to the last part of my short statement, in which I have undoubtedly repeated some of the ideas I outlined in my speech of 24 September 1968 accepting the Presidency of the Assembly. It is a mistake to think that the United Nations is merely an organization with its Headquarters on the East River. True, this magnificent building is its physical symbol and the Secretary·General is its permanent intellectual and moral symbol. But the United Nations is not simply a body composed of five organs-the General Assembly, the three Councils and the Secretariat-nor is it even its constantly growing host of subsidiary organs. The United Nations is all this and something more, which for twenty·three years we have forgotten: its Member States, their peoples and Governments. These form the sixth and undoubtedly the most important of the United Nations organs. The rest merely serves to channel and facilitate expressions of opinion and intention. Whenever there is a question of effective action, this is primarily the responsibility of the Member States; and so long as they fail to realize this responsibility and obligation, or shirk assuming them and translating thought into action, the United Nations will remain a mythical
 
 
487. Then too, we must not forget that before these Member States, that is, we ourselves and the Governments that we represent, take action and decisions, it is imperative for us to disarm our peoples emotionally. Until the people are ready to eschew emotion and violence, their leaders can do nothing, and political and diplomatic affairs will be of no avail.
488. With these reflexions, -which I would ask you to convey to your Governments, we conclude our twentythird session. It has been many years now since the Assembly last left any agenda items pending, and we hope that international relations in the coming year will not compel us to meet again. During this session, besides the discussions, and resolutions adopted. two new Members were admitted to the United Nations-Swaziland and Equatorial Guinea-to which I again extend a most cordial welcome.
489. I should like to thank you all, especially for your consideration during my illness, which prevented me from being with you at certain times to shape the character of tlus twenty-third session of the General Assembly or to direct it along certain paths. I am particularly grateful to the seventeen Vice.Presidents, who so loyally took over the leadership of the Assembly when, almost without warning, I had to drop the reins myself. My appreciation also goes to the Chairmen, and to the Vice-Chairmen, Rapporteurs and Secretaries, of the main Committees. My last words will be to thank the Secretary-General for his intelligent and calm understanding, his unwavering support and loyalty, and the friendship which he has extended to me and which I more than reciprocate. His immediate collaborators and advisers, particularly Mr. Narasimhan, the Under.Secretary for General Assembly Affairs, have also earned my gratitude
490. I wish you all a merry Christmas and a happy New Year"
10136,"Richard Nixon, Presidential Inauguration Speech",https://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/nixon1.asp,Richard Nixon,President (United States),Inauguration Speech,1969,,"Senator Dirksen, Mr. Chief Justice, Mr. Vice President, President Johnson, Vice President Humphrey, my fellow Americans--and my fellow citizens of the world community:

I ask you to share with me today the majesty of this moment. In the orderly transfer of power, we celebrate the unity that keeps us free.

Each moment in history is a fleeting time, precious and unique. But some stand out as moments of beginning, in which courses are set that shape decades or centuries.

This can be such a moment.

Forces now are converging that make possible, for the first time, the hope that many of man's deepest aspirations can at last be realized. The spiraling pace of change allows us to contemplate, within our own lifetime, advances that once would have taken centuries.

In throwing wide the horizons of space, we have discovered new horizons on earth.

For the first time, because the people of the world want peace, and the leaders of the world are afraid of war, the times are on the side of peace.

Eight years from now America will celebrate its 200th anniversary as a nation. Within the lifetime of most people now living, mankind will celebrate that great new year which comes only once in a thousand years--the beginning of the third millennium.

What kind of nation we will be, what kind of world we will live in, whether we shape the future in the image of our hopes, is ours to determine by our actions and our choices.

The greatest honor history can bestow is the title of peacemaker. This honor now beckons America--the chance to help lead the world at last out of the valley of turmoil, and onto that high ground of peace that man has dreamed of since the dawn of civilization.

If we succeed, generations to come will say of us now living that we mastered our moment, that we helped make the world safe for mankind.

This is our summons to greatness.

I believe the American people are ready to answer this call.

The second third of this century has been a time of proud achievement. We have made enormous strides in science and industry and agriculture. We have shared our wealth more broadly than ever. We have learned at last to manage a modern economy to assure its continued growth.

We have given freedom new reach, and we have begun to make its promise real for black as well as for white.

We see the hope of tomorrow in the youth of today. I know America's youth. I believe in them. We can be proud that they are better educated, more committed, more passionately driven by conscience than any generation in our history.

No people has ever been so close to the achievement of a just and abundant society, or so possessed of the will to achieve it. Because our strengths are so great, we can afford to appraise our weaknesses with candor and to approach them with hope.

Standing in this same place a third of a century ago, Franklin Delano Roosevelt addressed a Nation ravaged by depression and gripped in fear. He could say in surveying the Nation's troubles: ""They concern, thank God, only material things.""

Our crisis today is the reverse.

We have found ourselves rich in goods, but ragged in spirit; reaching with magnificent precision for the moon, but falling into raucous discord on earth.

We are caught in war, wanting peace. We are torn by division, wanting unity. We see around us empty lives, wanting fulfillment. We see tasks that need doing, waiting for hands to do them.

To a crisis of the spirit, we need an answer of the spirit.

To find that answer, we need only look within ourselves.

When we listen to ""the better angels of our nature,"" we find that they celebrate the simple things, the basic things--such as goodness, decency, love, kindness.

Greatness comes in simple trappings.

The simple things are the ones most needed today if we are to surmount what divides us, and cement what unites us.

To lower our voices would be a simple thing.

In these difficult years, America has suffered from a fever of words; from inflated rhetoric that promises more than it can deliver; from angry rhetoric that fans discontents into hatreds; from bombastic rhetoric that postures instead of persuading.

We cannot learn from one another until we stop shouting at one another--until we speak quietly enough so that our words can be heard as well as our voices.

For its part, government will listen. We will strive to listen in new ways--to the voices of quiet anguish, the voices that speak without words, the voices of the heart--to the injured voices, the anxious voices, the voices that have despaired of being heard.

Those who have been left out, we will try to bring in.

Those left behind, we will help to catch up.

For all of our people, we will set as our goal the decent order that makes progress possible and our lives secure.

As we reach toward our hopes, our task is to build on what has gone before--not turning away from the old, but turning toward the new.

In this past third of a century, government has passed more laws, spent more money, initiated more programs, than in all our previous history.

In pursuing our goals of full employment, better housing, excellence in education; in rebuilding our cities and improving our rural areas; in protecting our environment and enhancing the quality of life--in all these and more, we will and must press urgently forward.

We shall plan now for the day when our wealth can be transferred from the destruction of war abroad to the urgent needs of our people at home.

The American dream does not come to those who fall asleep.

But we are approaching the limits of what government alone can do.

Our greatest need now is to reach beyond government, and to enlist the legions of the concerned and the committed.

What has to be done, has to be done by government and people together or it will not be done at all. The lesson of past agony is that without the people we can do nothing; with the people we can do everything.

To match the magnitude of our tasks, we need the energies of our people--enlisted not only in grand enterprises, but more importantly in those small, splendid efforts that make headlines in the neighborhood newspaper instead of the national journal.

With these, we can build a great cathedral of the spirit--each of us raising it one stone at a time, as he reaches out to his neighbor, helping, caring, doing.

I do not offer a life of uninspiring ease. I do not call for a life of grim sacrifice. I ask you to join in a high adventure--one as rich as humanity itself, and as exciting as the times we live in.

The essence of freedom is that each of us shares in the shaping of his own destiny.

Until he has been part of a cause larger than himself, no man is truly whole.

The way to fulfillment is in the use of our talents; we achieve nobility in the spirit that inspires that use.

As we measure what can be done, we shall promise only what we know we can produce, but as we chart our goals we shall be lifted by our dreams.

No man can be fully free while his neighbor is not. To go forward at all is to go forward together.

This means black and white together, as one nation, not two. The laws have caught up with our conscience. What remains is to give life to what is in the law: to ensure at last that as all are born equal in dignity before God, all are born equal in dignity before man.

As we learn to go forward together at home, let us also seek to go forward together with all mankind.

Let us take as our goal: where peace is unknown, make it welcome; where peace is fragile, make it strong; where peace is temporary, make it permanent.

After a period of confrontation, we are entering an era of negotiation.

Let all nations know that during this administration our lines of communication will be open.

We seek an open world--open to ideas, open to the exchange of goods and people--a world in which no people, great or small, will live in angry isolation.

We cannot expect to make everyone our friend, but we can try to make no one our enemy.

Those who would be our adversaries, we invite to a peaceful competition--not in conquering territory or extending dominion, but in enriching the life of man.

As we explore the reaches of space, let us go to the new worlds together--not as new worlds to be conquered, but as a new adventure to be shared.

With those who are willing to join, let us cooperate to reduce the burden of arms, to strengthen the structure of peace, to lift up the poor and the hungry.

But to all those who would be tempted by weakness, let us leave no doubt that we will be as strong as we need to be for as long as we need to be.

Over the past twenty years, since I first came to this Capital as a freshman Congressman, I have visited most of the nations of the world.

I have come to know the leaders of the world, and the great forces, the hatreds, the fears that divide the world.

I know that peace does not come through wishing for it--that there is no substitute for days and even years of patient and prolonged diplomacy.

I also know the people of the world.

I have seen the hunger of a homeless child, the pain of a man wounded in battle, the grief of a mother who has lost her son. I know these have no ideology, no race.

I know America. I know the heart of America is good.

I speak from my own heart, and the heart of my country, the deep concern we have for those who suffer, and those who sorrow.

I have taken an oath today in the presence of God and my countrymen to uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States. To that oath I now add this sacred commitment: I shall consecrate my office, my energies, and all the wisdom I can summon, to the cause of peace among nations.

Let this message be heard by strong and weak alike:

The peace we seek to win is not victory over any other people, but the peace that comes ""with healing in its wings""; with compassion for those who have suffered; with understanding for those who have opposed us; with the opportunity for all the peoples of this earth to choose their own destiny.

Only a few short weeks ago, we shared the glory of man's first sight of the world as God sees it, as a single sphere reflecting light in the darkness.

As the Apollo astronauts flew over the moon's gray surface on Christmas Eve, they spoke to us of the beauty of earth--and in that voice so clear across the lunar distance, we heard them invoke God's blessing on its goodness.

In that moment, their view from the moon moved poet Archibald MacLeish to write:

""To see the earth as it truly is, small and blue and beautiful in that eternal silence where it floats, is to see ourselves as riders on the earth together, brothers on that bright loveliness in the eternal cold--brothers who know now they are truly brothers.""

In that moment of surpassing technological triumph, men turned their thoughts toward home and humanity--seeing in that far perspective that man's destiny on earth is not divisible; telling us that however far we reach into the cosmos, our destiny lies not in the stars but on Earth itself, in our own hands, in our own hearts.

We have endured a long night of the American spirit. But as our eyes catch the dimness of the first rays of dawn, let us not curse the remaining dark. Let us gather the light.

Our destiny offers, not the cup of despair, but the chalice of opportunity. So let us seize it, not in fear, but in gladness-- and, ""riders on the earth together,"" let us go forward, firm in our faith, steadfast in our purpose, cautious of the dangers; but sustained by our confidence in the will of God and the promise of man."

However, no one can dissuade us from our conviction that the Germans have a right to self-determination just as any other nation. The object of our practical political work in the years immediately ahead is to preserve the unity of the nation by easing the tenseness of relations between the two parts of Germany. The Germans are not only connected by reason of their language and their history with all its splendor and its misery, we are all at home in Germany. And we still have common tasks and a common responsibility to insure peace among us and in Europe. Twenty years after the establishment of the Federal Republic of Germany and of the GDR we must prevent any further alienation of the two parts of the German nation; that is, arrive at a regular modus vivendi and from there proceed to cooperation. This is not just a German interest, for it is also important for peace in Europe and for East-West relations. Our own attitude and that of our friends toward the international relations of the GDR depends on the attitude of East Berlin itself. It is, by the way, not our intention to curtail the benefits derived by our compatriots from international trade and cultural exchanges. The Federal Government will continue the policy initiated in December 1966 by Chancellor Kiesinger and his government and again offers the Council of Ministers of the GDR negotiations at government level without discrimination on either side, which should lead to contractually agreed cooperation. International recognition of the GDR by the Federal Republic is out of the question. Even if two states exist in Germany, they are not foreign countries to each other, their relations with each other can only be of a special nature. Following up the policy of its predecessor, the Federal Government declares that its readiness for binding agreements on the reciprocal renunciation of the use or threat of force applies equally with regard to the GDR. The Federal Government will advise the United States, Britain, and France to continue energetically the talks begun with the Soviet Union on easing and improving the situation of Berlin. The status of the city of Berlin under the special responsibility of the four powers must remain untouched. This must not be a hindrance to seeking facilities for traffic within and to Berlin. We shall continue to insure the viability of Berlin. West Berlin must be placed in a position to assist in improving the political, economic, and cultural relations between the two parts of Germany. We welcome the renewed increase of intra-German trade. This has partly been due to the facilities provided by the agreement of 6 December 1968. The Federal Government considers a further expansion of these neighborly trade relations desirable."
10140,"Angie Brooks, PGA Inauguration Speech",http://undocs.org/en/A/PV.1839,Angie Brooks,President of the General Assembly,Inauguration Speech,1969,,"3. The TEMPORARY PRESIDENT: This is the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Organization established ""to save succeeding generations from the scourge ofwar"" . We therefore meet at a moment when we must not only take stock of and evaluate the past, but also plan with foresight and daring for the future. It is our duty to seek to dispel those increasing doubts which have arisen about the effectiveness of our Organization, and to restore that element of hope and trust which existed when the United Nations was founded.
4. In my inaugural statement as President of the twenty-fourth session ofthis Assembly, I dwelt atsome length on some of the internal weaknesses of this Organization: the parochialism and the lack of a sense of reality with which business is oftentime conducted. 5. In the real world, today as then, we are confronted with violence and armed conflicts on almost every continent. The tragic situation in Viet-Nam still continues. The Middle East crisis, which a few weeks ago gave some glimmer ofhope, would now seem to have regressed into its uncompromising stand. 6. Power politics and/or political expediency continue tofrustrate and impede, ratherthanoffer a genuine outright effort to solve, once and for all, the questions of Korea and of the representation of China at the United Nations. This principle seems to apply also in some other parts ofthe world where there is a desire by the people to be reunited.
7. I am deeply concerned that the need for the United Nations to establish a permanent peace-keeping force at the service ofjustice and not of arbitrary politicians is not being given proper consideration by the United Nations, through its authorization and financing. A permanent peace-keeping force is not the total answer to the question of peace-keeping-in view ofthe power struggle which plagues the world-but it is true that a peace-keeping force could separate warring Powers, make negotiated settlements more likely, and reduce the chance that a local conflict would develop into a global war.
8. Again, a new kind of threat to international peace and security is emerging by: (a) the hijacking ofinternational aircraft, endangering the lives of innocent passengers and crew, who at times are also held as hostages, as well as the destruction of property and/or the aircraft; (b) diplomats, while serving their countries, are sometimes kidnapped at their posts and killed. These are serious problems to which the United Nations must give careful consideration. Both nationally and internationally there is need for measures to be established and meaningful support to be given to avert such criminal acts, as ehey are a menace to international relations, create barriers to international understanding, and thereby pose a threat to international peace and security.
9. Action in the field of disarmament is relatively slow; the gong has been sounded by Secretary-General U Thant as to the urgency for Members of the United Nations-and, I may add, the world in general-to subordinate theIr ancient quarrels and launch a global partnership to curb the arms race.
10. In Africa, the anachronistic State of South Africa continues in all its repressive glory despite the numerous resolutions of the United Nations condemning its practices of apartheid as a violation of the principles of the Charter and of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The efforts of the United Nations in support of the right of the people of Namibia to selfdetermination and independence under the provisions of the Charter and resolution 1514 (XV) are thwarted through the repressive laws and rigid implementation thereof by South Africa, which is a Member of the United Nations and a signatory of the Charter. In Rhodesia, the illegal repressive regime continues, against the interest of the majority of the African population; the Portuguese Territories of Angola, Mozambique and Guinea (Bissau) are still in the grip of colonialism-all despite the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples.
11. In addition, one cannot rule out the inescapable fact that the greatest obstacle to the realization of the principles of the Charter lies in the fact that power politics continuesto operate, both overtly and covertly, in international relations. The concept of power politics whether the instrument of nationalism or of ideological extremism, is the natural enemy of international order as envisaged in the Charter, Patriotism, national pride or ideological conviction can and must take new and more creative forms than the old concepts of political domination and material power. This is a challenge to statesmanship and political genius in all regions of the world.
12. Those and other similar situations constitute a setback to international order and one is bound to wonder, as is sometimes done, if the United Nations in its present form has outgrown its usefulness.
13. Nevertheless, there are certain areas where the United Nations can boast ofsome measure ofsuccess. In the regions of health and education, the United Nations, through its specialized agencies, has done a great deal of constructive work. But, coming from a small country, I should like to dwell a little on international co-operation for development.
14. Over the last twenty years the transfer of resources from the developed to the developing countries has been unprecedented in history. Economic growth in many ofthe developing countries has, therefore, in many cases, proceeded even at faster rates than the industrialized countries ever enjoyed at a similar stage in their own history.
15. All that sounds very good. But when we rememberthe low level ofdevelopment afterthe departure of the colonial Powers, we realize that even with these development rates the standard of life for many in the developing countries has not been sufficiently affected.
16. As we sit here today in our gracious surroundings, in order to inject a better sense of reality we should keep reminding ourselves that more than two-thirds of mankind still lives in conditions of abject poverty, of disease and social backwardness, These conditions do not conduce to international amity. Economic disparities are as great a threat to peace as ideological differences. 17. Despite this, we find, unfortunately, that international support for development"" has continued to flag since the early sixties, and the widening gap between the developed and the developing countries continues to be a central issue of our time. Some of the donor countries have become disenchanted with development aid, partly because of unrealistic expectations of immediate development by the recipient countries; partly because in many cases it does not seem politically advantageous any more; partly because of the increasing seriousness of their own internal domestic inequalities, and urban and environmental problems. 18. Some developing countries, too, are themselves showing signs of frustration and impatience with their development programmes. Economic development is seen as a continuation of the political struggle for independence, and easy and instant prosperity was expected. Unfortunately this cannot be. Meaningful broad-based economic development is a slow and often painful process.
19. Without going too deep into all the problems of development, I would urge the rich countries not to weary in their aid programmes-if not for moralistic reasons, then for enlightened and constructive selfinterest. The fullest possible utilization ofthe resources of the world, human and physical, will benefit both the rich and the poor countries with the consequent increase in international trade. 20. It is in the area oftrade that their most meaningful and self-sustaining economic growth can be achieved. The stimulation of exports is vital to the developing countries. Exports transform their resources into foreign exchange, and the greater the foreign exchange earnings the less the need for aid. It is here that the developed countries could really make their most useful adjustments, given the will to do so. 21. The commodity problems of price instability and adverse price trends of the primary products of the developing countries are well known. Yet at the same time they are forced to pay higher prices for imported manufactured and capital goods. In the light of this I would urge, as a second session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development has done, the industrial countries to lower the barriers to trade such as high and discriminatory import quotas and regulations of all kinds on products of special interest to the developing countries.
22. In the past we have relied too much on words. For the future we must aim for what is possible and see that it is done. Our Charter provides for all that is presently possible in a world of independent and sovereign States, but we must put it into fuller effect. We must implement its security provisions. We Must pay more attention to our duty to seek a peaceful settlement of our international disputes. We must dedicate more time, effort and resources to overcoming poverty, disease, discrimination and illiteracy. We must meet, through international co-operation, the challenges of the world of the 1970s: an end to wars, strife and the armaments race, the threats of over-population and pollution, the need for orderly regimes for the new resources science makes available to us beneath the sea and in outer space.
23. In the modern world no nation can be an island unto itself. The need for the United Nations, where we can meet and seek to resolve our common problems, is dictated by the realities of present-day life. We must face those realities squarely. We must seek to replace the national interest by the international interest. The challenges before us are therefore enormous as we meet today for this twenty-fifth General Assembly.
24. The theme of the twenty-fifth anniversary is ""peace, justice and progress"". We know that peace and justice are two commodities in rather short supply today. They are two principles we constantly praise in words but often deny in deeds. But peace andjustice are two commodities with many components. They are also inextricably bound to each other. To move forward to theirrealization requires more than anything else a will on the part of States to accept increasingly some form of third-party resolution of their disputes. They must be ready to give real substance to their obligations under Article 33 of the United Nations Charter.
25. Peace and justice are essential to our continued survival. Even if the record has been uneven-and there are grounds for some disappointrnent-s-I still believe that the United Nations is essential to peace andjustice. Can you imagine a, world without a general international organization of the scope of the United Nations in which international peace and justice would flourish? To that, my answer is a definite no.
26. In this venture for peace, justice and progress I know that the youths, the future leaders oftomorrow, and the women of the world, have a contribution to make. I ask that this opportunity be afforded them by their national States and on the international level. 
27. Fellow representatives, as I take my leave of this podium, I wish you well in your task. I am sure that you will extend to my successor the quartet, consideration and wise counsel you afforded me last year. We must make this session a landmark in man’s age-old desire and striving for peace, justice and progress.
28. Mr. Secretary-General, I tahnk you for your kindness, your counsel and assistance during my tenure of office. My thanks go also to your staff for its cooperation.

10141,"Edward Heath, PM Inauguration Speech",http://www.britishpoliticalspeech.org/speech-archive.htm?speech=117,Edward Heath,Prime Minister (United Kingdom),Inauguration Speech,1970,,"We are met here together today to celebrate a famous victory. None can deny us that - well, hardly anyone. At the end of such a successful Conference as you have just had, there is all the more reason for us to rejoice together. ‘Ah, just an automatic ritual,’ some say. After five years hard slog in Opposition, let me tell them that there is nothing automatic or ritualistic about it. These celebrations are the real thing.

I find today that the world is divided into two groups - those who are proudly boasting that their opinion poll was at any rate within six points of where we got to, even though they said we were going to lose, and those who are still busy writing and publishing books proving in fact that we lost. So to the satisfaction of winning, which we all feel, must be added the additional satisfaction of proving so many people wrong - outside our own Party, of course.

Historians will long acclaim this, not only as a famous victory, but as a triumph for the common sense of the British people. It was that which always sustained me, and it is for that reason that I was always confident of victory. To you, Chancellor of the Exchequer, for three years Chairman of the Party, I accord the thanks of the whole Party as the organiser of victory. To all my colleagues who laboured with us throughout those long years of opposition, and in particular to that most loyal, devoted and selfless Deputy Leader of the Party, Reggie Maudling - I express the deepest thanks of the Party.

There is only one note of sadness which dims the lustre of this occasion. Today, Chancellor of the Exchequer, you sit in the chair where Iain Macleod as President of the National Union would have sat but for his sudden and untimely death. Nowhere in our Party, and least of all in a Party Conference, will we ever underestimate or allow to be forgotten the contribution which Iain Macleod made to the affairs of our Party and of the nation. Our sadness today is lightened by the memory of what he achieved through his life and work.

All too many kind things have been said during this week about myself - not that they are any less agreeable at this stage for that - and you have added to them today. This makes me very happy. But, members of the Conservative Party, the victory was yours. It is your victory and it is one on which I congratulate you from the bottom of my heart. Throughout the years of opposition, despite the stresses and strains, inside as well as without, the Party kept its balance. It maintained its direction; it held to its purpose. It regained the confidence of the nation; and today it provides the Government of the country. And it is as head of that Government that I speak to the nation here today.

We have been summoned to the service of the nation - a nation seeking fresh outlets for its energies, a nation looking for new opportunities for its people: more encouragement, greater reward for its activities, happier conditions for the community at large. In sum, a nation wanting to embark on a new course towards that better tomorrow which we all seek. We pointed the way in the election campaign, although some saw it only dimly and others refused to look at all. We were returned to office to change the course of history of this nation - nothing less. It is this course, the new course, which the Government - your Government - is now shaping.

We have found in government, as I warned the country we would, that at every turn we fine limitations - limitations imposed on the nation in part by past events and in part by the failures of our predecessors: limitations of the economy, of heavy international indebtedness, of enormous and increasing public expenditure, of a high and damaging level of taxation: limitations of outmoded industrial relations and increasing losses through strikes: limitations of wildly excessive wage demands encouraged deliberately by the last Administration for its own political purposes: limitations of a stagnant economy and roaring inflation. And overseas we face the limitations of the broken pledges of the last six years and, above all, of defeatist attitudes after continuing retreat.

We have found, as we expected, that our room for manoeuvre is limited. But what that means is this: that we must create that room to manoeuvre for ourselves. That is what the Government is now doing. It means in every sphere taking fully considered decisions, making in each case a deliberate choice. My concern as head of the Government is that we should have available the best means of reaching those decisions and that the country should understand clearly the reasons for the choices which we make.

Already overseas we have made a start - a start in gaining freedom of manoeuvre for British diplomacy and a start in showing how effective it can still be. In the Far East, Lord Carrington, the Secretary of State for Defence, working ably and quietly, has reached agreement with the other four Commonwealth countries - Australia, New Zealand, Malaysia and Singapore - on the five Power arrangement which we proposed in Opposition, an arrangement to help maintain peace, stability and prosperity in that all-important area. Our contribution will be limited - far smaller than at present and at modest cost. Many will be surprised how successful we have been. The critics will be routed, and full tribute should go to the Secretary of State for Defence for his work. When this arrangement is completed, I believe it will be overwhelmingly accepted both in this country and in South-East Asia. It will become a major part of our diplomatic influence in the Far East.

We are now engaged in working out how best to contribute to the stability of the Gulf. In Europe we have begun negotiations for entry into the European Economic Community. I doubt whether many people realise how great a burden it imposed on the Government in its first few days of existence to review the negotiating position and to send you, Mr. Chairman, to Brussels to begin those negotiations. But we were determined that there should be no delay whatever in the timetable arranged by our predecessors with the Community for the start of those negotiations. We were determined and we succeeded in carrying through the start of them. For it remains our conviction that if we can negotiate the right terms it will be in the long term interests of Britain and of the British people to join the European Economic Community - and not only in the interests of Britain, but in the interests of Europe also; not only in the interests of Europe, but I believe in the long term interests of the Commonwealth.

As so many of you know, I have always upheld the value of the Commonwealth as an influence for good in world affairs. We have shown that we gladly listen to the views of its members and take account of them. But the Commonwealth can only thrive - and of this I am absolutely convinced - if all its members realise that Britain, like themselves, enjoys full independence of action. Whatever arguments we in Britain may have here amongst ourselves, British policy is, and is going to remain, a matter for decision by the British Government.

As our freedom of manoeuvre as a country increases, we shall be able more and more to play a major part in seizing the opportunities which events open up for us. It may well be that in four great areas of the world we are at the beginning of a period where these opportunities will prove to be greater than they have been for many years. In South-East Asia, as the policies of the United States to withdraw from Vietnam develop - and the President’s initiative is welcome and ought to be fully supported - there may be a chance to establish a new pattern of stability and cooperation in that area. Both our interests as a country and our experience in that part of the world will fit us to go on playing a role there. In the Middle East, Britain now has an opportunity, as the violent emotions of the past are stilled, to put our relations with the Arab world on to a new and more realistic basis - an opportunity to contribute to peace and security for all the States in that area.

In Africa it is our duty as well as our interest to work, as Conservative Governments have done before, to avoid physical conflicts between peoples of different races. Other solutions, requiring no doubt long and patient negotiation, must be found to the differences which exist between the races. The outcome of strife can only be suffering for all. There again, we, the British, are well equipped to help to find a solution to these differences and to resolve them peaceably.

In our Continent the agreements so far reached between Western Germany and the Soviet Union may present the opportunity now of resolving other differences between East and West. So long as the Soviet Union recognises the need for Western security, we, this Government, will be active and indeed enthusiastic in working with our allies towards a settlement of the long outstanding European problems.

This Government is now moving into a new era of British diplomacy. How effective our leadership can be has already been shown in the way we handled the affairs of the hostages and the Jordan war. We have so much to contribute from our experience in diplomacy and, above all, in being so fortunate and indeed proud as to have a Foreign Secretary so greatly experienced and widely respected as Sir Alec Douglas-Home. We are leaving behind the years of retreat. We are determined to establish the reputation of Britain once again, a reputation as the firm defender of her own interests and the skilful and persistent partner of all those who are working for a lasting peace.

We are shaping a new course in our affairs at home. We have created what we promised, a new style of government. For the first time you have had the opportunity at this Conference - a very successful Conference - to see something of how the new style is being carried out. If I sense aright, you rather like the new style as you see it here in Blackpool and you have liked the Ministers who have exemplified the new style. Let me make one reservation, it is not going to continue exactly as it has been here. I do not propose that the Scottish President of the Board of Trade should always answer English local government debates! But you have welcomed the Ministers, and I am grateful to you for that, grateful for the support which you have given my colleagues and for the way in which you have endorsed what they have had to say to you.

Of course, it is not just a matter of style, it is a matter of doing the right things at the right time. I know that here, too, I can count on you to endorse what has already been achieved, because already in the first six weeks of our Government we implemented the pledges we had given to you and to the country. We restored freedom to local authorities to decide their own form of educational arrangements - no more compulsory comprehensives. We restored freedom to local councils to sell council houses and to tenants freedom to buy them. We are abolishing the Land Commission and have taken the necessary steps. We have introduced the Bill to give pensions to persons over 80 who, through no fault of their own, so far have none. In addition, Robert Carr, quietly and firmly, handled the dock dispute and received full praise for it.

The Home Secretary backed the reforms of the Northern Ireland Government, and in the very first days we met the need for more troops to help control the situation there. Northern Ireland is part of the United Kingdom and will remain so for as long as its people wish. That constitutional position must be maintained. Every support will be given to those who are carrying through the present programme of reforms. In these circumstances, there can be no justification for the differences which exist in society in Northern Ireland today being allowed to break out into open conflict, demanding the presence there of many thousands of British troops, many more than there could be such justification in Lancashire or Yorkshire, Scotland or Wales. We believe that we stand for moderation and toleration. It is these virtues which must now re-assert themselves in Northern Ireland. It is these qualities which must speedily bring to an end this ugly chapter in the history of Northern Ireland.

While the Government were handling successfully as heavy a load as any in recent history we put in hand in rest of the preparations necessary for us to pursue. Then we went on holiday, to be back on 1st September. A holiday - what an extraordinary idea! People’s hands were lifted in horror and some of those who had already been away were loudest in their shrill shrieks. Of course, if I had gone and sat on an island somewhere, out of the way, and just watched the boats pass by, that would have been unexceptional, perhaps even commendable; but because I got on a boat and sailed past the islands… (Laughter and applause)

Now the nation is seeing, and will see more and more in the next few weeks, the fruits of our labours. Last Monday, details were published in full of our industrial reforms - a brilliant piece of work by Robert Carr and those who have been working with him. ‘Will they ever do it?’ the sceptics asked. Now they know. It is ‘Fair Deal at Work’ and more - consultations, the Bill before Christmas and the Act on the Statute Book this Session.

Last Tuesday, provision was taken to expand our agricultural production and save on our imports. That you received here well, if I may say so. Indeed, it is becoming a dangerous situation when, for the first time in living memory, a Minister of Agriculture receives a standing ovation at a Party Conference.

I shall shortly be announcing the reconstruction of the Whitehall Departments. This will be of major importance and wide-ranging. My object is to produce as far as possible a rational structure of Government which will enable us to streamline the Departments and reduce the demands which are made on money and manpower. My objective is also to produce a better way of taking decisions and to provide the Cabinet with the means for doing so. I hope that this reconstruction when it is achieved will provide Whitehall with a period of stability which it badly needs. I hope it will provide a structure which will be effective and which will last for many years to come.

After the House resumes, as you know, the Chancellor of the Exchequer will announce his proposals for dealing with Government expenditure. These are the consequence of the first review of functions being carried out by the Government. I would like to make this point to you: what we have been doing is something entirely different from the previous exercise in making sudden and arbitrary cuts in Government expenditure. This is the redirection of Government expenditure, the withdrawal of some Government functions and a change of priority in others, leading in all to a better and more justifiable use of public money.

The Chancellor of the Exchequer has made plain that whatever cuts are made in Government expenditure, however unpleasant they may be, are the full collective responsibility of all his colleagues in the Government and he has indicated to you that should there at any future date be any reductions in taxation they should be accredited fully to the benefit of the Chancellor himself.

On top of this will come the announcement of the details of our policy in connection with this redistribution of public expenditure - our policy on housing, on education, on social security and on the relief of poverty. We shall announce our proposals on defence.

These, then will be the first fruits of our first few months in office. They are of major consequence, but I repeat that this is but the first stage to create room for us to manoeuvre as we move on to our new course. To follow this, I have now asked each Minister to organise an examination of every function carried out in his department, to examine personally the consequences, and then to recommend whether it is essential for each of these functions to continue. The purpose of my request is to ensure that Government withdraws from all those activities no longer necessary either because of the passage of time or because they are better done outside government, or because they should rightly he carried on, if wanted at all, by individual or by voluntary effort.

You will see that our strategy is clear. It is to reorganise the functions of Government, to leave more to individual or to corporate effort, to make savings in Government expenditure, to provide room for greater incentives to men and women and to firms and businesses. Our strategy is to encourage them more and more to take their own decisions, to stand on their own feet, to accept responsibility for themselves and for their families.

Our purpose is to bring our fellow citizens to recognise that they must be responsible for the consequences of their own actions and to learn that no one will stand between them and the results of their own free choice. Until this is made clear up and down the country, not only will men and women themselves, but their fellow citizens in the community as well, suffer from the feckless behaviour of irresponsible groups within our community.

This strategy I have outlined will lead to an expanding economy which will enable the standard of living of all our people to rise. It will lead to the improvement - a genuine improvement - in the social services for the community as a whole. It will provide a sound economic basis for our defence abroad and it will enable us to maintain our aid to the developing world. This strategy is necessary to be able to defeat inflation, the menace of rising prices at home, so damaging to exports overseas and to our position in the world outside. No one can deny that today the major cause of the inflation from which we are suffering is the excessive wage demands, not only those which have been made but those which have been met. We have said that in the public sector we have a particular responsibility. It is the responsibility of an employer, direct or indirect. But it is also a responsibility to you, the taxpayer and the ratepayer, because when the Government are called upon to provide resources necessary, then they can only provide them from what is taken from you in rates and taxes.

We do not expect any discrimination between the public and the private sectors. We shall act as responsible employers and we expect others, the private employers, to do the same. But this we have also made clear: if they go their own way and accede to irresponsible wage demands which damage their own firms and create a loss of jobs for those who work in them, then the Government are certainly not going to step in and rescue them from the consequences of their own actions.

Now I call the Party to a fresh task. We are setting out on this new course. It is your task and it is this I ask of you at the end of this Conference - to help to move the country along that course with us. No longer is it the task of the Party just to criticise our opponents. This Conference has been notably free of such criticisms - not because there is not ample room for it but because all that our opponents are saying is so obviously irrelevant to the problems with which we are dealing now in the 1970s.

The task of the Party is no longer that of just explaining the policies we would follow if we were returned to power, however well you have done that in the years of opposition.

The task of the Party is no longer just that of keeping us, the leaders, up to the mark.

Now is the time for the positive and constructive work which goes with office and responsibility. As we, the Government, swing into action, so the Party in the country must become the spearhead of the movement to change the attitude of the people of Britain, to explain the choices before us, to back the Government’s decisions.

Let the people see for themselves up and down the land what Conservatives stand for, what Conservatives are like, what they do when they are given responsibility. I look to you to do that now, from this day on, when you go back to your constituencies. And when you do wholeheartedly, then we shall achieve as a Party what we failed to do in 13 years of power. We shall have won the hearts and the minds of our people, and we shall permanently change the outlook of the British nation.

When I arrived at No. 10 four months ago I said - and I said what I meant – ‘To govern is to serve.’ And the single most important service that I believe this Government can perform for the British people is to restore to them more and more freedom.

But to do this the Government must first free itself. I talked earlier of room to manoeuvre, and I have spoken of the kind of government we mean to have. The question now that we are in office is not what kind of government, but how much government. The answer, with which I know you agree, is that there must be less government, and of a better quality.

It will not happen overnight. Maybe there will be no day that you can mark on the calendar and say, ‘That was Freedom Day.’ It is a continuing process which will happen by degrees. But it is going to happen in every aspect of our daily life. It will not always be obvious; gradually it will become apparent.

And I ask you and the nation to get used to this idea of change, because it is going to be the pattern of this Government, and I urge you and the nation not to fear the danger but to recognise the opportunity, the opportunity to meet the challenge that change represents.

We in the Government have already accepted the challenge, and I warn the nation that there is no alternative. To stand still today is to go backwards. To cling desperately to the present will be to find ourselves embracing only the past.

Change will give us freedom, and with freedom most go responsibility. The free society which we aim to create must also be the responsible society - free from intervention, free from interference, but responsible: free to make your own decisions, but responsible also for your mistakes; free to enjoy the rewards of enterprise, but responsible for making sure that those rewards are justly and fairly earned; free to create for yourselves and your families that better tomorrow which we all want, but responsible for those who, through no fault of their own, cannot create it for themselves; free to lead a life of your own, but responsible to the community as a whole.

This then is the task to which your Government is dedicated: to give to all our people both freedom and responsibility. That is the challenge and from it will come opportunity. Opportunity to take our destiny, the destiny of the nation, once again in our own hands. If we are to achieve this task we will have to embark on a change so radical, a revolution so quiet and yet so total, that it will go far beyond the programme for a Parliament to which we are committed and on which we have already embarked; far beyond this decade and way into the 1980s. For it is the task of building something of style, of substance, and worth; something so important to the life and the future of this country of ours. We can only hope to begin now what future Conservative Governments will continue and complete. We are laying the foundations, but they are the foundations for a generation.

That is our aim, and that is the context in which we are working. It is a task that will take all our efforts and all of yours, every member of our party up and down the country; the efforts of every citizen of the nation. But it is a task worthy of all of us. It will require open minds, it will require great courage; but it will provide opportunities for this generation that few generations have ever seen. It is a task that calls for all of us to do all that lies in our power. It is a cause that this Government - your Government, the Government of the nation - is proud to serve."
10145,"Edvard Hambro, PGA Inauguration Speech",http://undocs.org/en/A/PV.1934,Edvard Hambro,President of the General Assembly,Inauguration Speech,1970,,"3. The TEMPORARY PRESIDENT: We have just terminated the fIrst year ofthe second quarter century ofthe life of this Organization. We note with regret that there has been little discernible progress dUring the last year with regard to the situation in the Middle East and the prevailing conditions of colonial suppression and racial discrimiriation in southern Africa. But on the positive side an imrortant development has taken place since we last met. The United States of America and the People's Republic ofChina have taken steps with a view to normalizing their relations. These steps will undoubtedly have considerable significance also for the United Nations, and may eventually lead to increased possibilities for the Organization to perform its functions under the Charter. Furthermore, the Quadripartite Agreement on Berlinl represents an ~portant contribution to a continuation of detente between Eastern and Western Europe. 4. Also on tht'1 positive side the Treaty on the Prohibition of the Emplacement of Nuclear Weapons and Other Weapons of Mass Destruction on the Sea-Bed and the Ocean Floor and in the Subsoil Thereof[resolution 2660 (XXV), annex] was signed on 11 February this year by 67 States in London, Moscow and Washington. 1 Signed at Berlin on 3 September 1971. Address by Mr. Edvard Hambro, Temporary President, Chairman ofthe delegation ofNorway 5. However, the signature ofthat Trenty is only one oftlll~ many steps which must be taken in order to create a new regime for the seas, what is in them, on them and under them. A/PV.1934 6. The preservation of the marine environment is of special importance not only because the oceans are a major source of food and the main road oftransportation among nations but also because the oceans are a vital element in our planetary life system and the continuous life cycle of our globe. 7. Consequently the time has long since passed when the oceans could be used as a dumping place for ever-increasing masses of harmful waste, and measures on the national level will not suffice; we must fmd international solutions to these problems.
8. The environment and the t111'~ai from pollution have been recognized as important' isl>ues in both the United Nations and the specialized agencies. Therefore, nations are following with special attention the preparatory work bemg performed for the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment to be held at Stockholm in June 1972. That Conference can-and must-become of crucial importance for our world.
9. It would also be tight and proper at the twenty-sixth session of the General Assembly to give the highest prior:ty to the problems of disarmament. The ban on production and possession or biological and toxin weapons, which is now the subject of negotiation, should be followed up as soon as possible by a ban on chemical weapons itl accordance with the resolution of the General Assembly
10.. Earlier this year one ofthe greatest tragedies in human terms since the last world war erupted in the Asian sub-continent. Millions of refugees suffer untold misery. The internationai community has again generously responded to appeals for assistance in the humanitarian field. But the money and supplies made available are still not sufficient and prove the urgency ofmaking further progress in the field of international disaster relief. This event has also shown how very tenuous is tl'1e li...'1e of demarcation between humanitarian relief and political action. May I express the fervent hope that such cmlditions will soon be established that the flow ofrefugees can be stopped and the refugees return home.
11. Moreover, it is of urgent importance that in the years ahead our Organization should be strengthened in all possible ways.
12. It would be a small but still important step in the right direction if we could take serious measures to solve the fmancial crisis ofthe United Nations.
13. One dominant impression which I gathered as President of the twenty-fifth session was that all delegations, without exception, have a strong interest not only in preserving but also in strengthening the United Nations. I wonder, however, if all Members fully realize that this will not be possible unless a solution is found to the fmancial difficulties ofthe Organization.
14. As members will know, responding to a request from the Secretary-General at the end of the last session of the Assembly, I undertook to join him in his efforts to search for ways and means by which solutions to these difficulties might be found so that the Organization could be put on a sound and working footing.
15. I have the distinct impression that the seriousness of the situation-and I do not hesitate to call it the desperate seriousness of the situation-was, in some cases for the first time, brought home to many delegations. However, we are still looking for a significant break-through that could give us some realistic hope of saving the United Nations machinery from grinding to a halt in the not very distant future.
16. I still hope that the common interest in saving the prestige and capabilities of the United Nations will be strong enough to avoid the fmancial bankmptcy of the Organization, and I am glad to be able to tell you that negotiations are still actively going on. AGENDA ITEM 80 19. The problems in front of us are great indeed and will call for all our strength, inlagination and dedication and, above all, the political will of Governments to solve these problems.
17. We should show a greater sense of proportion and a keener understanding of priorities if we redressed the glaring and tragic imbalance between what the nations spend on armaments and what they are willing to spend for peace and constructive purposes.
18. This session of the General Assembly will also be called upon to take important decisions in the economic and social field, particularly with regard tt !he evaluation machinery to be set up for review and lr\)Vaisal of the progress achieved in the implementation of the measures and attainment of objectives embodied in the International Development Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade [resolution 2626 (XXV)}. The Economic and Social Council has presented to the Assembly a comprehensive recommendation on these matters, a recommendation that \vill, it is hoped, serve as a useful basis for the Assembly's deliberations ofthe issues involved
19. The problems in front of us are great indeed and will call for all our strength, inlagination and dedication and, above all, the political will of Governments to solve these problems.

10149,"Adam Malik, PGA Inauguration Speech",http://undocs.org/en/A/PV.2032,Adam Malik,President of the General Assembly,Inauguration Speech,1971,,"The TEMPORARY PRESIDENT: The past year has brought continual, far-reaching change in the pattern of power relations in the world. The accelerated pace at which this change has come about has transformed this pattern -much faster than we thought possible-into a much more diversified power constellation, replacing the ideological rigidity ofthe early cold-war era. 
We have followed with great interest the evolving process of mutual accommodation and rapprochement between the major Powers of the world. This development has been welcomed by us all, for it has ushered in an atmosphere of detente, which is the necessary first step towards global peace. The printed official records ofthe plenary meetings of the General Assembly are published in fascicle form, the record of each meeting being issued separately. A prefatory fascicle is issued for each session, containing a table of contents and the agenda. 5. One of the beneficial consequences of the relaxation of tensions between the United States and the Soviet Union has been the development of more cordial and positive relations between the countries of Eastern and Western Europe. Now the prospect of a reduction of the nuclear arms race offers the opportunity to the highly developed nations to channel funds, previously used for armaments, to developing nations in order to assist those nations in achieving their goals of economic and social emancipation.
6. From among those subjects for which a degree of progress can be rightfully claimed, I take particular note of the recent agreements between the United States and the Soviet Uni')n on the limitation of strategic offensive and defensive nuclear weapons. To be sure, these agreements are still limited in scope; but they neverthele$5 represent a commendable start in the direction of meaningful nuclear arms control and present us with the hope for more comprehensive strategic arms limitation accords in the near future. Both the United States and the Soviet Union deserve all the encouragement of the international community in furthering their efforts in this most important aspect of detente.
7, The approaches towards a normalization of relations between the United. States and China are likewise to be welcomed as reinforcing the conditions for an effective reduction of international tensions. In this connexion China's entry into the United Nations last year can also be seen as reflecting the view-increasingly being accepted by the international community-that each ofits Members has an equal responsibility for the fate of humanity and that every nation must play its commensurate role in the world Organization,
8. i also know that you will share with me a sense -of relief in seeing armed conflict on the south Asian subcontinent ended and the peoples of that region moving from the battlefield to the conference table. It is even more heartening to see that India and Pakistan have actually started talks on finding a just and honourable settiement to all those problems that have for so long divided them. It is our ardent hope, therefore, that before long the spirit of reconciliation will also move Pakistan and Bangladesh to establish normai and peace relations.
9. It is imperative that all those problems should be effectively and integrally resolved, so that the energy of the great peoples of India, Pakistan and Bangladesh can be directed towards dealing with the ravages of past violence and war. We all know how sensitive and deeply rooted are the issues that have set the countries of the subcontinent against one another. But if each of them negotiates with the other while possessed with a deep sense of magnanimity and with an awareness of the need for accommodation, then I am. sure these problems will not be destined to lie beyond resolution.
10. Another encouraging development has been the quiet, yet most significant, progress achieved in the efforts of both North Korea and South Korea to normalize their relations in the framework of an eventual reunification of the two parts. These moves by the two Koreas towards rapprochement, mirroring the similarly encouraging trend between the two Germanys in Europe, strengthen our hopes that our world Organization may soon witness the peaceful resolution of the problem of the so-called divided countries.
11. Our optimism concerning the positive effects of detente, however, is tempered by an awareness of how limited the present detente still is, both in its substance and in its geographical scope. While, during the past year, we may have seen encouraging progress being made towards the realization of the goals of the United Nations, we have also witnessed the worsening of problems that have been of concern to the international community for quite some time.
12. We must note with deep regret that the fighting in Indo-China still continues. It is my fervent hope, however, as I know it is yours, that the present session of the General A'jsembly will be able to witness the beginning of the end of the human suffering and senseless destruction that is Viet-Nam.
13. The past year has brought little promise of an improvement in the situation in· the Middle East. I remain steadfast in my belief, however, that the only road to a peaceful settlement will have to go by way of strict compliance, by all concerned, with all Security Council and General Assembly resolutions adopted with regard to this problem. For, if nothing else, the recent tragic incident at Munich has pointed up the desperate urgency for us to resolve the root-causes of the Palestinian problem, lest the inevitable recurrence of such symptoms continue to plague our conscience.
14. Neither should we forget that other intolerable methods of inflicting human anguish yet remain, such as the evils of racism, apartheid and colonial exploitation, which still beset the suppressed peoples ofsouthern Africa.
15. Though the changing international climate can contribute to the avoidance of a nuclear conflict, the possibility and actuality of local wars seem to continue unchecked. We are all aware that the use and threat of force and of prestmre are very much a part of the present-day world. As I speak here today, some nations are still engaged in the politics of power and of confrontation. 
16. We are now in the third year of the Second United Nations Development Decade. But we are still nowhere near the realization of one of the fundamental aims of the Charter: to create those conditions of peace and well-being that would assure a standard of liVing compatible with human dignity for all mankind. Instead, we now observe a continual, and worsening, imbalance in the distribution of wealth and of power between the developed and the developing nations, further compounded by such problems as over-population, maldistribution of resources, mass unemployment and so forth. It is not to be denied that economic development remains the primary responsibility of the individual nations. The crucial link between international peace and international social justice, however, cannot be ignored. The problems of economic development, therefore, should be accepted as a common challenge to the developing and the developed countries alike. Unless ""both join hands in sincerely and effectively implementing the aims and strategy of the Second Development Decade, the sound basis for global peace and security will remain as remote as ever.
17. These-and the other problems we face in the remaining decades of the century are not problems simply of one or two nations. A nuclear confrontation is not going to limit its destruction to the sphere of the nuclear Powers alone. No single nation can be secure while another nation is beset with a sense of insecurity < No nation can enjoy the full extent of economic development as long as other nations remain destitute, for the economic fabric of the world is like a single chain which is only as strong as its weakest link. Every nation will suffer when the earth is unable to provide its inhabitants with those resources that are necessary for a decent life. Neither is the environment subject to the sovereignty of nations. When it is diseased for one nation it is diseased for all nations
18. Permit me, on this occasion, to express my sincere hope that all of us assembled here will extend the fullest support to the next President of the General Assembly in his task, not only ofsteering our wodd body into facing up to its immense task of shaping a new and better world of tomorrow, but also and simultaneously of enhancing the viability of the United Nations as the best instrument to reach that goal.
19. Let me observe that in this quest we are truly fortunate to be able to rely on a man of such experience and talent as Mr. Kurt Waldheim, our new SecretaryGeneral.
20. With this in mind, and deeply convinced of our joint and firm commitment to the measure· of co-operation necessary to face the arduous tasks before us, I strongly believe that the success of the twenty-seventh session of the General Assembly will far outshine those of previous sessions.

10150,"Kurt Waldheim, SG Inauguration Speech",http://undocs.org/en/A/PV.2031,Kurt Waldheim,Secretary General (United Nations),Inauguration Speech,1972,,"Appointment of the Secretary-General of the United Nations 101. The PRESIDENT: The General Assembly has before it a letter dated 21 December 1971 from the President of the Security Council to the President of the General Assembly [A/8496]. It reads as follows: ""I have the honour to inform you that the Security Council at its 1620th meeting, held in private on 21 December 1971, adopted resolution 306 (1971) concerning the appointment of the Secretary-General of the United Nations. The resolution reads as follows: "" 'The Security Council, "" 'Having considered the question of the recommendation for the appointment of the Secretary-General of the United Nations, ., 'Recommends to the General Assembly that Mr. Kurt Waldheim be appointed Secretary-General of the United Nations' "". The letter is signed by Mr. Ismael Byne Taylor-Kamara, President of the Security Council. . 102. In connexion with this recommendation of the Security Council, the General Assembly has }-ofore it a draft resolution submitted by 15 Member States in document A/L.671/Rev.l. That is the only document before the Assembly on which action is requ~red. 103. I now call on the representative of Argentina. 104. Mr. ORTIZ DE ROZAS (Argentina) (interpretation from Spanish): Yesterday the Security Council adopted a resolution, of the utmost important and significance for the future of our Organization, which recommends to the General Assembly the appointment of Mr. Kurt Waldhei""'l1 as Secretary-General of the United Nations. 105. The decision of the Council, taken after intensive consultations and deliberations, has demonstrated its maturity and sense of justice in recognizing in Mr. Waldheim the qualities, background and merits which are required to discharge the functions of the highest international post. Merely mentioning his name in this hall makes it unnecessary to offer an introduction or to make any reference to his curriculum vitae. In a distinguished career which has seen him fulm duties at the highest level, he has displayed exceptional competence, reliability, devotion and a sense of responsibility, which have earned great prestige for him personally and also for the great country he represents. ' 106. In addition to his personal qualities, Mr. Waldheim has the essential characteristics and merits of one of the oldest civilizations and cultures in Europe. Austria, his home country, is today a factor for unity and understand11lg between the East and the West. It ~s neutral politically and constitutionally, and tllis nation today is offering us one of its outstanding sons to carry out the difficult tasks of the Secretary-General which, by their very nature, require an independence ofjudgement, impartiality of spirit and procedural objectivity, if the interests that inevitably will try to influence hjm are to be resisted.
107. For many of the countries represented here, and in particular for the developing countries, the office of Secretary-General is and should be a guarantee of neutrality. We believe that neither his vast authority nor his prestige should be affected by power politics. We consider that to this end Mr. Waldheim should align himself with his distinguished predecessors, and that a categorical statement of the firmest and broadest possible support for him should be forthcoming from the General Assembly. 108. With this aim in mind, I call upon by friends and colleagues from all the regional groups to adopt by acclamation draft resolution A/L.671/Rev.l, which I have the privilege and, of course, the great hqnour of presenting to this distinguished Assembly. 109. I am absolutely convinced that I am reflecting the feeling of all the countries represented here when J convey to Mr. Kurt Waldheim our congratulations in advance and our fervent wishes that success may ever be his in the difficult tasks that he is about to unJertake. His success will be the success of the United Nations and of all of us. It will be the triumph of the cause of peace and justice throughout the world.
110. : cannot conclude this presentation without devoting my final words to the man who for 10 years has guided the destinies of our Organization, leaving on it the inimitable mark of his dignity, confidence in harmonious co-existence among nations and respect for human values. For many years he will be identified as the living symbol of the United Nations, and we wish most gratefully to pay heartfelt tribute to U Thant. 111. The PRESIDENT: Members have heard the request by the representative of Argentina. 112. May I take it that it is the wish of the General Assembly to adopt draft resolution A/L.671/Rev.l by acclamation?
The draft resulution was adopted by acclamation (resolution 2903 (XXVI)). 113. The PRESIDENT: I have the honour to announce that His Excellency Mr. Kurt Waldheim has been appointed by acclamation Secretary-General of the United Nations for a term of office beginning 1 January 1972 and ending on 31 December 1976. The President of the Security Council, the President of the Economic and Social Council, the President of the Trusteeship Council, the Vice-Presidents of the General Assembly and the Chairmen of the Main Committees took places on the platform. Mr. Sinan Karle, Chief ofProtocol, conducted Mr. Waldheim to the platform. 
114. The PRESIDENT: Your Excellency, I have the honour to inform YGU officially that the General Assembly has appointed you Secretary-General of the United Nations for a term of office beginning 1 January 1972 and ending on 31 December 1976. 
115. I ask Mr. Waldheim to repeat after me the oath of office.
116. Mr. WALDHEIM: I, Kurt Waldheim, solemniy swear to exercise in all loyalty, discretion and conscience the functions entrusted to me as Secretary-General of the United Nations, to discharge these functions and regulate my conduct with the interests of the United Nations only in view, and not to seek or accept instructions in regard to the performance of my duties from any government or other authority external to the Organization.
117. The PRESIDENT: I feel sure that on this occasion I speak for every member of the General Assembly in extending our congratulations to the Secretary-Generalelect. We welcome him most warmly, and we pledge him our full co-operation and support. We wish him a very fruitful term of office and extend all our best wishes to him in his future endeavours in the interests of the international community. May the United Nations, und.er his dynamic and imaginative leadership, move further forward in becoming the centre for harmonizing the actions of nations, as foreseen in the Charter.
118. I now invite His Excellency Mr. Kurt Waldheim to make a statement.
119. Mr. WALDHEIM: I have listened with deep emotion to the words of welcome which the President has just addressed to me. They reflect the confidence and the trust my colleagues in this hall have placed in me and the honour they have done to my country in appointing me to this high office. I should like to thank them most warmly for their support and also to express my gratitude to the President and the members of the Security Council for unanimously recommending my name to the General Assembly.
120. I am profoundly aware that the important tasks defined by the Charter which r 'Ie been entrusted to me entail heavy respons7·,i1 'ties. It is my solemn pledge that I will try to fulfil them to the best of my abilities with impartiality and a deep sense of personal commitment.
121. Almost all of my colleagues present here knC'w me personally, and many of them have worked with me for many years. They might remember me as Permanent Observer of Austria to the United Nations as long ago as 1955 or from my more recent tours of duty at the United Nations. They know t.~at I come from a permanently neutral country, a country which does not rely on military alliances and which has a vital interest in the promot~on and implementation of the principles and provisions of the United Nations Charter. 122. In my new role as Secretary-General of the United Nations, I shall continue to pursue those objectives and contribute actively to a strengthening of the Organization in order that the United Nations may develop into an effective instrument for the performance of all the functions envisaged in the Charter.
123. The United Nations has arrived at an important cross-roads. The participation of the People's Republic of China is a major step on the road towards universality which will no doubt increase the United Nations capability of working for the objectives of the Charter. A further step in trJs direction would be the admission of the divided countries, which I hope will be brought about in the not too distant future. 124. A brief look at the membership table of this Organization makes us realize that more than two thirds of the Member nations belong to the developing countries. They represent the vast majority of mankind and their problems deserve our closest attention in the carrying out of our tasks. It has been said before t;lat development is the key to peace. Accordingly, in carrying out the primary objective of the Charter, which is the maintenance of international peace and secuiity, we have to see to it that the basic elements upon which peace and prosperous evolution are built are recognized and made available for our common good. 125. Mutual confidence and trust in the procedures of peaceful settlement of disputes as well as in the peacemaking and peace-keeping functions of the United Nations, together with harmonious economic and social development, are the essential aspects of this problem.
 
126. The United Nations should be a centre for political and economic development alike, where due regard is also mven to the furtherance of unanimously accepted rules of conduct between nations. 127. In order to ensure the successful functioning of the United Nations, the financial solvency of the Organization is a basic prerequisite without which resolutions and decisions remain mere declarations ofintent. Indeed, in this field, as well as in the political and economic field, the credibility of our Organization is directly linked with the problem ofimplementing decisions once taken.
128,. In order to be able to discharge the heavy responsibilities entrusted to· me and to overcome the difficulties which the Organization will have to cope with, I shall need the full support and co-operation of all Member States, and I shall have to rely on the understanding and friendship of my colleagues. I myself will endeavour to co-operate and communicate with them very closely in every possible way. 129. I shall also need the loyal collaboration of all the members of the Secretariat. I myself have practical experience of the variety of problems with which an administration of such dimensions is confronted. This experience will help me to give the necessary consideration to matters related to the effective functioning of the United Nations administrative machinery.
130. In the fulfIlment of.my mandate I shall continue in the direction indicated by my distinguished predecessor, Secretary-Ceneral U Thant. In trying to come nearer to the goal set out by the Charter, I hope I shall make as much headway as he did and I will endeavour to be imaginative and realistic as he was in devising new approaches to the common objectives which unite us in this Organization. 131. I should like to conclude with a deep-felt tribute to Secretary-General U Thant, to whom I pay homage for the outstanding example and high standards he has set both in the conduct of this Organization and as a colleague and friend."

November 1972 Ich bin in dieser Stunde allen Wählerinnen und Wählern Dank schuldig, die mit ihrer Stimme ihr Vertrauen in meine Partei und damit auch ihr Vertrauen zu mir bewiesen haben. Das ist für mich kein Augenblick der Triumphes, wohl aber ist es ein bewegender Augenblick der Genugtuung und des Stolzes und zugleich der Bescheidung; denn wir fühlen uns durch diesen Sieg unserer Sache in die Pflicht genommen. Ich erkenne in dem Wahlergebnis den Auftrag, zusammen mit Herrn Scheel und seinen Freunden die Arbeit fortzusetzen, die wir in den vergangenen drei Jahren gemeinsam mit Erfolg eingeleitet haben. Die Mehrheit hat uns bestätigt, daß wir auf dem rechten Kurs sind. Nicht nur die Bevölkerung der großen Städte hat ihre kritischen Sympathien uns demonstriert. Meine Partei begegnete draußen im Land einer zunehmenden Aufgeschlossenheit, und ich beobachte mit besonderer Freude den Geist wachsender Offenheit unter unseren katholischen Landsleuten. Den Freien Demokraten gratuliere ich zu ihren Gewinnen. Ich stelle fest, daß das Regierungsbündnis für beide Seiten gut anschlägt. Mein Respekt und meine Wünsche gelten selbstverständlich auch allen, die ich zu achten habe. Wir können in einer Demokratie nicht alle einer Meinung sein, und die Regierung ist und bleibt dem Ganzen des Volkes, dem Wohl des Ganzen verpflichtet. Der Wahlkampf ist hart geführt worden, und nun wollen wir wieder zur guten Nachbarschaft zurückfinden. Freilich werden wir kaum vergessen können, daß wir auch gegen unlautere Formen, unlautere Methoden der Werbung, gegen Unsachlichkeit, gegen Treulosigkeit und gegen die inflationäre Schwemme von Geldern zu kämpfen hatten. Unsere Demokratie darf an solchen düsteren Praktiken nicht Schaden nehmen. Zum anderen sind vor allem von den Jungen bewundernswerte Energien für die Aufklärung der Bevölkerung mobilisiert worden. Und die echten Wählerinitiativen haben bewiesen, daß sie vielerorts ein neues bürgerliches, mitbürgerliches Selbstbewußtsein repräsentieren. Der Zustrom des guten Willens wird uns helfen, unverzüglich mit der Arbeit zu beginnen, die wir zu leisten haben. Es gilt mit der Verbesserung der Qualität des Lebens hier und jetzt anzufangen. Ohne Fortschritt gibt es keine Stabilität. Wir werden uns mit großem Ernst, freilich ohne Ängstlichkeit, um das Problem der Preise kümmern. Mit unserer Reformarbeit wollen wir ein gutes Haus bestellen, dessen Firste gewiß nicht in die Wolken der Utopie ragen. Die Stimme unseres Landes – und ich sage dies besonders gern in diesem Augenblick zusammen mit Walter Scheel –, die Stimme unseres Landes in der Welt hat an Gewicht gewonnen. Die Gefahr einer Isolierung der Bundesrepublik zwischen Ost und West ist gebannt. Wir werden im weltweiten Prozeß der Entspannung, der zugleich voller Spannungen ist, mit großer Intensität teilnehmen, und wir werden jede Chance nutzen, um die Einigung Europas vorwärts zu bewegen. Im kommenden Jahr sollen die beiden Staaten Deutschlands Mitglieder der Vereinten Nationen werden. Auch dies stellt uns neue Aufgaben, vor allem was die Beziehungen mit der DDR angeht, die den Menschen hüben und drüben helfen sollen. Wir wollen, was an uns liegt, zu einer neuen Norm der Humanität finden. Ich bin bereit, den Grundvertrag noch vor Weihnachten zu unterzeichnen. Für den großen Auftrag, den wir gradlinig fortführen, suchen wir die Gemeinsamkeit der Verantwortlichen – bei meinen Freunden und bei dem fairen Partner der vergangenen drei Jahre. Ich suche sie aber auch bei der Opposition. Und ich hoffe, daß sie sich nun dazu entschließen wird, sich nicht länger in erster Linie als eine Interessengemeinschaft für den Regierungssturz zu betrachten. Für beide, für Regierung und Opposition, geht es um die Glaubwürdigkeit; denn von ihr lebt der Geist der Demokratie, von dem wir sagen können, daß er eine gesicherte Heimat in Deutschland gefunden hat. Diese Wahl hat die neue politische Mitte gestärkt. Ich werde das Notwendige tun, damit sie sich in den kommenden vier Jahren als die große, die bindende Kraft unsere Volkes bestätigen wird. Nun gehen wir gelassen, doch mit Freude an die Arbeit für unsere Bundesrepublik Deutschland, für den Frieden, dem Wort verpflichtet, mit dem wir uns im Herbst 1969 auf den Weg machten: „Wir wollen ein Volk der guten Nachbarn sein im Inneren und nach außen.“","Declaration by the Federal Chancellor and chairman of the SPD, Willy Brandt, on the outcome of the federal election on November 19, 1972 I owe this hour to all voters who have shown their trust in my party and thus their trust in me with their vote . For me this is not a moment of triumph, but it is a moving moment of satisfaction and pride and at the same time of humility; for we feel that this victory has made us responsible for our cause. I recognize in the election results the mandate to continue with Mr Scheel and his friends the work that we have successfully initiated together over the past three years. The majority have confirmed that we are on the right course. Not only the population of the big cities has shown us their critical sympathy. Out in the country my party encountered increasing openness, and it is with particular pleasure that I observe the spirit of increasing openness among our Catholic compatriots. I congratulate the Free Democrats on their wins. I can see that the government alliance is working well for both sides. Of course, my respect and wishes also apply to everyone I have to respect. We cannot all agree in a democracy, and the government is and remains committed to the whole of the people, to the good of the whole. The election campaign was tough, and now we want to find our way back to good neighbors. Of course, we will hardly be able to forget that we also had to fight against unfair forms, unfair methods of advertising, against negligence, against faithlessness and against the inflationary glut of funds. Our democracy must not be damaged by such gloomy practices. On the other hand, especially the young people mobilized admirable energies for the education of the population. And the real voter initiatives have shown that in many places they represent a new bourgeois, fellow-bourgeois self-confidence. The influx of goodwill will help us immediately begin the work we have to do. We need to start improving the quality of life here and now. There is no stability without progress. We will deal with the problem of prices with great seriousness, albeit without fear. With our reform work we want to order a good house, the roof of which will certainly not protrude into the clouds of utopia. The voice of our country - and I particularly like to say this at this moment together with Walter Scheel - the voice of our country in the world has gained in importance. The danger of isolation of the Federal Republic between East and West has been averted. We will participate with great intensity in the worldwide process of détente, which is also full of tension, and we will use every opportunity to move forward the unification of Europe. In the coming year, the two states of Germany are to become members of the United Nations. This, too, presents us with new tasks, especially in relation to relations with the GDR, which are supposed to help people on both sides. We want to find what is up to us a new norm of humanity. I am ready to sign the basic contract before Christmas. For the big order, which we are continuing in a straight line, we are looking for common ground between those responsible - with my friends and with the fair partner of the past three years. But I also look for them in the opposition. And I hope that it will now decide to no longer see itself primarily as an interest group for the overthrow of the government. For both the government and the opposition, credibility is at stake; for the spirit of democracy lives from it, and we can say that it has found a secure home in Germany. This choice has strengthened the new political center. I will do what is necessary so that it will affirm itself as the great, binding force of our people over the next four years. Now we go calmly, but with joy in the work for our Federal Republic of Germany, for peace, committed to the word with which we set out in autumn 1969: “We want to be a people of good neighbors internally and externally .

10156,"Stanislaw Trepczynski, PGA Inauguration Speech",http://undocs.org/en/A/PV.2117,Stanislaw Trepczynski,President of the General Assembly,Inauguration Speech,1972,,"3. The TEMPORARY PRESIDENT (interpretation from French): Another year has passed since our Assembly opened its last session. As far as developments in the world are concerned, it has been a year out of the ordinary, bringing forth and paving the way for changes which mark an historic epoch. 4. Never before have hopes of abiding peace and security in the world been so real, the prospects so close, or the chances so great. It behoves the United Nations to do everything in its power to see to it that these hopes are not disappointed, that the prospects do not recede and that the chances are not wasted. 5. Our Organization can only prove equal to these great challenges if it makes a contribution worthy of it to the great current of healthy change, if it harnesses its proceedings and the concerted efforts of its Members towards making this process a permanent and irreversible one. 6. Today, with many momen .0US international meetings and the conclusion of fateful agreements behjnd us, we can now speak of a new juncture in the world situation. The policy of peaceful coexistence is becoming more and more generally the rule governing relations between States with different social systems. We have arrived at the threshold of a new historic era for the community 'of nations. Let me express my whole-hearted belief that no people which is truly concerned with its own happiness and that of other nations, and which sincerely aspires to lasting peace, that no country, big or small, can be the loser from a policy of peaceful coexistence, the principle3 of which lie at the very foundation of the Charter of our Organization. On the contrary, everyone stands to gain and ought to gain from the fruits of such a policy. 7. War has always brought in its wake the devastation of the material and cultural achievements of whole generations, while peace has been the sine qua non of economic development and progress. In our times, advances in science and technology have multiplied both the destructive power of war and the creative force of peace as a dynamo in the development of all areas of life. It is only in a context of detente and peace that there can arise an equitable and purposively shaped international division of labour, based on equal rights, that is advantageous to all people.
8. In the past year, we have also seen changes which have furthered the universalizatioJ'. of our Organization along the lines that many Member States have for a long time urged from the rostrum of this Assembly. At the last session of the General Assembly, 27 years after the end of the Second World War, observers from both tIte German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany for the first time took their seats together in thi3 hall. Both these States, whose eminent representatives we are happy to welcome in our midst, are this day to become full-fledged Members of the United Nations. We are equally pleased to be able to greet the first observer from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. We are glad that the membership of this Organization will be increased by the new State of the Bahamas. Also before us is the topical question of the admission of Bangladesh to the United Nations.
9. Despite the difficulties, the world is marching forward, fired by the determination and will to action on the part of nations. Although it is an uphill path, not without setbacks, and the pace is often a strain on our patience progress is nevertheless being seen to be made, and increasingly so, on almost every continent.
10. In Asia, the prospects of a lasting peace are looming larger. The hotbeds of conflict and war are gradually dying out. The world is not losing hope that the termination of the war in Viet-Nam will bring peace to all the nations of Indo-China. Encouraging reports of the normalization of relations are coming in from the Indian subcontinent. There is more and more talk in Asia of the need to devise a regional system of security and co-operation.
11. In Africa, the tenth anniversary of the Organization of African Unity was a symbol of the changes which are taking place and the aspirations of the many States on that continent. Undaunted by obstacles and difficulties, Africa is steering a valiant course of renewal and doggedly cllsting off the relics of the colonial past. In this struggle for freedom, AmiIcar Cabral, who was among us at the twenty-seventh session, has sacrificed his life.
 12. In Latin America, a continent on which-thanks to the cordial hospitality of a number of Governments-I was able to make an extremely useful political tour last spring, progressive transformations are accelerating development, despite the difficult struggle against retrograde forces. We were deeply shocked by the news of the sudden and tragic death-during the recent dramatic events experienced by the Chilean people-of President Salvador Allende, who was the guest of our Assembly less than a year ago.
13. In Europe, the realities arising out of the results of the Second World War have been irrevocably recognized. The Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, whose second phase begins in Geneva today, has in effect spelled the end of the post-war period on this continent and the opening of a new era in which a repetition of the.tragedy of war should never again be possible. We are supported in this conviction by the fact that the Conference on Security and
Co-operation, also attended by the United States and Canada, is the first meeting of equal and sovereign partners in the history of Europe which has gathered not for the purpose of carving up the continent or deciding the fate of others, but to organize its own structure of peace, security and co-operation
14. We look forward to the imminent success of the Conference not only because we feel that it serves the real interests of Europe, but also because we look at it in the perspective of the indivisibility of world peace and the influence that the possibility of organizing a system of collective security in Europe can have on similar arrangements in other parts of the world
15. The efforts at disarmament pursued at various levels give rise to new hopes, especially with regard to the convening of the World Disarmament Conference.
16. The Fourt-I-]. Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries, held in Algiers earlier this month, was a new manifestation of the prominent role which these countries play in the struggle for the achievement of the principles of the Charter of the United Nations. We all hope that the decisions of the Conference will also contribute to the successful work of our session.
17. The voice of public opinion will soon make itself clearly heard at the World Congress of Peace Forces, due to meet in Moscow in a few weeks. We are pleased to note that public opinion and the great social movements in many countries are, with increasing vigour, aligning themselves in concert with world joint action in favour of peace, detente and co-operation.
18. Though aware that there still survive relics and thro'- <Jacks to the old days and that many sources of tension and conflict continue to fester in various quarters of the globe, we are stressing the positive side of the balance sheet since the pressure of these achievements, the climate of spreading detente and mounting international co-operation wiII make it easier to eradicate the anachronistic legacy of the past. Just as we have managed to stamp out many of the ills of this world, so we are bound sooner or later to be rid of the remnants of colonialism, of the spectre of hunger which still haunts millions of people, of social injustices and racial discrimination. We must grapple with discriminatory practices in international trade and in the field of economic co-operation and with the danger of forfeiting the distinctive values of nations and individuals.
19. Above all, we must extinguish the embers of conflict and war in the Middle East, which are now the greatest peril. Not only is the situation there incompatible with the decisions of our Organization; it also runs counter to the logic of developments in the world and for that reason cannot continue.
20. Public opinion cannot tolerate the poisoning of the international atmosphere by the all too numerous vestiges of power politics at a time when it has foundered on all its main frunts. Like peace, ti~tente too must be indivisible so that all can enjoy its blessings.
21. The responsibility of tackling these numerous problems falls on our Organization, which will the better acquit itself of its tasks the greater the degree of normalization that enters the over-all world situation. Moreover, there is no doubt that growing mutual understanding in this  hall and in the Assembly's Committees, and constructive contributions to the regular budget of the United Nations decisions by this body and their consistent implementation, within the terms of Article 19 of the Charter. will contribute to the improvement of the international atmosphere. The important thing is to ensure that international efforts and contacts, whether bilateral or multilateral, dovetail into successful solutions of the issues that are still outstanding. That purpose is also being served by the assiduous endp.avours. which we hold in high regard, of the Secretary-General of our Organization, Mr. Kurt Waldheim.
22. The plenitude of contemporary life means that the United Nations is continually coming up against new problems. This broad range of matters falling within the purview of our Organization is evidence of its vitality and significance, of its opportunities and great responsibilities.
23. Before closing I should like, on behalf of the members of the Assembly to express our heartfelt condolences to the Swedish delegation on the death of King Gustav VI Adolf.
24. May I be permitted once again to express my profound gratitude to all delegations and to the members of the Secretariat for their invaluable co-operation during the twenty-seventh session.
25. Let us hope that the present session, under the enlightened leadership of the new President whom we are about to elect, will prove a session of expedations fulfilled.

10162,"Leopoldo Benites, PGA Inauguration Speech",http://undocs.org/en/A/PV.2233,Leopoldo Benites,President of the General Assembly,Inauguration Speech,1973,,"3. The TEMPORARY PRESIDENT (interpretation from Spanish): It is an unshakable custom, constantly followed at previous sessions of the General A&sembly, that the Temporary President express his expectations regarding the new session; and, basing myself on that custom, I crave representatives' indulgence to make a few remarks. 4. I shall begin by expressing my conviction that the new President·-who will be elected in a few moments--will successfully carry out his complex and difficult task. He will be able to do that thanks to hi.s high qualifications. 5. In almost all fields of United Nations activities, new problems have emerged that will challenge our imagination, our prudence and our tact if we are to find adequate solutions to them. 6. In the political field we have seen that the use or the threat of the use of force, prohibited by the Charter and repudiated by mankind which this Organization r'epresents, has still not ceased to harvest death and to sow in the minds of men scepticism regarding the true effectiveness of the Organization. I am deeply convinced that the Assembly that is today beginning its work will find just solutions and return to horrified mankind its faith in the final abolition of force as a means of creating, destroying or modifying rights. We must carry to th~ minds and souls of people the conviction that their right to self-determination will always be respected with regard both to the achievement of full independence and to the full exercise of their sovereignty in setting up their own social and political regimes, and even that the rights of those peoples who for long years have awaited their moment ofjustice will be restored. 7. In the economic field the Assembly that is beginning its session today will have to' deal with urgent problems, particularly those arising out of the sixth special session of the General Assembly, of which . I had the honour of being President. The creation of the Special Fund to complement the emergency operation already undertaken by the SecretaryGeneral to help the developing countries, particularly those most affected by circumstances that have injured their economies, will be one of the topics of greatest interest once the report of the Economic and Social Council based on the recommendations of the Ad Hoc Committee on the Special Programme, in accordance with resolution 3202 (S-VI), is taken up for consideration. Perhaps an assessment of the result~ of those conferences closely linked to development whicl1 were held in the course of the present year will help us to find more precise solutions concerning, for example, population growth and the ways and means to be developed, particularly.in the assurance of a food supply, in order to avoid potential dangers. 8. One of the I'roblems that may cause the greatest concern and dismay regarding'the work of the United Nations is its present inability to act in the face of violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms, respect for which and safeguard of which constituted the very basis ofthe creation ofthe United Nations and which are set forth in the Preamble to the .Charter and in the definition of the purposes and principles of that document. 9. Another item that will be the focus of attention in the session of the Assembly which is beginning today will doubt!ess be the consideration ofthe report of the Special Committee on the Question of Defining Aggression [A/96/9]. I trust and hope that no divisive or confusing elements will be allowed to enter into that definition and that it will in concrete terms express what the international community has been awaiting for so many long years. 10. I shall not make a list of the problems, far less try to predict solutions that can only be arrived at by the General Assembly. I shall limit myself to expressing the hope that under the skilful guidance of the new President who is to be elected in a few moments. an outstanding son of Africa, the General Assembly will carry out serious and orderly work in its search for such solutions. 11. In closing the twenty-eighth regular session of the General Assembly yesterday [2232nd meeting], I said, and I now repeat, that we live at a moment when the course of history is being transformed; some systems are dying away, others are being born, particularly in the field of economic relations and in the establishment and strengthening of greater social justice. 12. In declaring open the present session of the General Assembly, I am imbued with the assurance that this body will do its historic duty."

The oath that I have taken is the same oath that was taken by George Washington and by every President under the Constitution. But I assume the Presidency under extraordinary circumstances never before experienced by Americans. This is an hour of history that troubles our minds and hurts our hearts.
Therefore, I feel it is my first duty to make an unprecedented compact with my countrymen. Not an inaugural address, not a fireside chat, not a campaign speech--just a little straight talk among friends. And I intend it to be the first of many.
I am acutely aware that you have not elected me as your President by your ballots, and so I ask you to confirm me as your President with your prayers. And I hope that such prayers will also be the first of many.
If you have not chosen me by secret ballot, neither have I gained office by any secret promises. I have not campaigned either for the Presidency or the Vice Presidency. I have not subscribed to any partisan platform. I am indebted to no man, and only to one woman--my dear wife--as I begin this very difficult job.
I have not sought this enormous responsibility, but I will not shirk it. Those who nominated and confirmed me as Vice President were my friends and are my friends. They were of both parties, elected by all the people and acting under the Constitution in their name. It is only fitting then that I should pledge to them and to you that I will be the President of all the people.
Thomas Jefferson said the people are the only sure reliance for the preservation of our liberty. And down the years, Abraham Lincoln renewed this American article of faith asking, “Is there any better way or equal hope in the world?”
I intend, on Monday next, to request of the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President pro tempore of the Senate the privilege of appearing before the Congress to share with my former colleagues and with you, the American people, my views on the priority business of the Nation and to solicit your views and their views. And may I say to the Speaker and the others, if I could meet with you right after these remarks, I would appreciate it.
Even though this is late in an election year, there is no way we can go forward except together and no way anybody can win except by serving the people’s urgent needs. We cannot stand still or slip backwards. We must go forward now together.
To the peoples and the governments of all friendly nations, and I hope that could encompass the whole world, I pledge an uninterrupted and sincere search for peace. America will remain strong and united, but its strength will remain dedicated to the safety and sanity of the entire family of man, as well as to our own precious freedom.
I believe that truth is the glue that holds government together, not only our Government but civilization itself. That bond, though strained, is unbroken at home and abroad.
In all my public and private acts as your President, I expect to follow my instincts of openness and candor with full confidence that honesty is always the best policy in the end.
My fellow Americans, our long national nightmare is over.
Our Constitution works; our great Republic is a government of laws and not of men. Here the people rule. But there is a higher Power, by whatever name we honor Him, who ordains not only righteousness but love, not only justice but mercy.
As we bind up the internal wounds of Watergate, more painful and more poisonous than those of foreign wars, let us restore the golden rule to our political process, and let brotherly love purge our hearts of suspicion and of hate.
In the beginning, I asked you to pray for me. Before closing, I ask again your prayers, for Richard Nixon and for his family. May our former President, who brought peace to millions, find it for himself. May God bless and comfort his wonderful wife and daughters, whose love and loyalty will forever be a shining legacy to all who bear the lonely burdens of the White House.
I can only guess at those burdens, although I have witnessed at close hand the tragedies that befell three Presidents and the lesser trials of others.
With all the strength and all the good sense I have gained from life, with all the confidence my family, my friends, and my dedicated staff impart to me, and with the good will of countless Americans I have encountered in recent visits to 40 States, I now solemnly reaffirm my promise I made to you last December 6: to uphold the Constitution, to do what is right as God gives me to see the right, and to do the very best I can f or America.
God helping me, I will not let you down.
Thank you."
10164,"Sir Harold Wilson, PM Inauguration Speech",http://www.britishpoliticalspeech.org/speech-archive.htm?speech=162,Sir Harold Wilson,Prime Minister (United Kingdom),Inauguration Speech,1974,,"Mr. Chairman, Fellow Delegates, I present to Conference the report of the Parlia­mentary Labour Party. This must be the first time in the history of our Party that the Parlia­mentary Report presented by the Leader spreads over not one, or two, but three Parliaments.

It covers the last dying months of the Con­servative majority Parliament (June 1970 to February 1974); the Parliament of minorities elected last February - the shortest Parliament in our history since 1886 - and now the Parlia­ment elected for five years, with a Labour majority. (Applause)

It has been a long 13 months, an historic 13 months, since Conference last met at Blackpool.

Those months spanned the greatest trade crisis of all time, not only for this country but for the whole of the industrialised world; the greatest industrial tragedy - unnecessary, utterly futile - in this country for nearly 50 years; and two General Elections which have transformed an outlook of despair into a prospect of hope for our country.

The Tories ran away from Government last February, but they ran away only just in time. Had they stayed any longer, disaster might have been inescapable.

You know, I am proud of our record in that short Parliament - not only of the good we have done but of the harm we have undone - beginning with the repeal of the Industrial Relations Act and the Housing Finance Acts and the scrapping of so many other measures by which the Tories had damaged the harmony and unity of our people. 

Despite the difficulties of that short Parlia­ment, despite a minority situation exploited in the division lobbies by our opponents with great bravery once they were sure that the holiday period prevented me from calling an immediate General Election - despite all these things - we moved faster to carry out the policies on which we had been elected than any Government since the War, not excluding the Attlee Govern­ment of 1945.

But not fast enough, apparently, for some. I was interested to read on the tape machine yesterday morning - at 8.17 a.m., 73 minutes before Conference began - a forecast of widespread attacks you were going to make upon the Government because, among other reasons, and I quote ‘the Manifesto on which the Election was won has not yet been implemented.’ (Laughter)

Well, I know we are quick workers, but it is only six weeks since we were elected. For once, I think I have the right to plead for a little more time.

The key to our success in October was that we were seen to be carrying out the pledges we gave to the people in February - pledges which were part of the programme on which the Party as a whole had worked so hard in the years of Opposition, the programme which produced the finest manifestos ever put before the electors of this country. (Applause)

But what October, the fourth election victory in less than ten years, means is this: that the Labour Party is now the natural patty of Government, not the natural party of Opposi­tion. (Applause)

Assuming that. this Parliament lasts its full course - and I do not see any reason why it should not, still less do I see any sign of a credible opposition to it - then of the 15 years from October 1964 to October 1979 Labour will have been in power for close on 11 years.

Today, this week, we have to examine - as the Parliamentary Labour Party has been doing since the election - the implications, the challenges and the responsibilities of having a Party no longer of Opposition only, no longer of protest only, but a Party of Government.

But let not that be taken by any of us, Cabinet or other party workers, Members of Parliament or local authority representatives, as meaning that we are no long a Party of protest. Were any of us to do so, then our position as a Party of power would wither at the roots, and it would deserve to do so. Labour is a Party of protest in Government as well as in Opposition. There is no one else. Protest against inequality, injustice, waste, the abuse of power, anti-democratic forces at home and abroad.

Should the Party abandon its posture of protest or its ability to make that protest effective within the democratic processes of the Party, then there is no future for us. And worse, no future for Britain.

I say this with a greater confidence because within our great national democracy I see displayed no qualifications for meaningful protest on the Opposition benches of the House of Commons. The principal Opposition party has become a territorial rump: rejected by Scotland, rejected by Wales, rejected by our main industrial and urban areas north of the Trent; they are now a regional party. (Applause)

It was because the nation remembered in October the Tory years leading up to last February. We had a Tory Government presid­ing over a Britain with the largest trade deficit in her history, a devastating trade deficit, four times greater than the one they left us in 1964 - the one we resolved.

And that deficit last autumn had accumulated before we felt - almost before we began to feel - the full impact of the oil price increases. 

It was a Britain where industrial growth had stopped.

Where prices were out of control.

Where Government-induced speculation was rampant, as house and land and commodity prices soared to all-time record levels.

Where, just before they lurched into the State of Emergency and the three-day week, their leader was proclaiming to the Institute of Directors last November that the only prob­lems Britain faced were ‘the problems of success.’

Today, with a Labour Government, now that the fight-back for Britain’s recovery is under way, it would appear that the Conservative Party consider they have a vested interest in national disaster, in talking Britain down, in exulting only when they perceive some event, some report, some statistics which can be turned to their own political advantage.

I regret seeing a once great and historic party now presenting an image of nothing so much as that well-known, down-at-heel, sandwich board character who parades down city streets proclaiming, ‘Prepare to Meet Thy Doom.’

Well, it’s a living. It has the advantage that no one can prove him wrong. (Laughter) Or right, either. But at least the sandwich man - I am talking about the trained one - does main­tain a day-to-day consistency. There is no record of anyone in that particular profession losing his credibility by proclaiming: ‘the world ends tomorrow, but I’ll see you get 9½ % mortgages by Christmas.’ (Laughter)

Mr. Chairman, having said that, I do not propose to spend any more words on the Con­servative Party. There are more important things this morning for us to discuss.

For this is the Conference where we accept, as the nation clearly wants us to accept, the obligation of being the Party of Government.

We have the duty to act responsibly, to tell the nation the facts, and what in our view must be done if the unparalleled problems and crises this country now faces are to be overcome, conquered, challenged, converted into oppor­tunity.

We have been elected on the policies that we have proclaimed with total clarity in two Manifestos within a single year.

We were elected because our record, even as a minority Government, in turning those pledges into reality, impressed all our people, and many others who had not traditionally supported Labour. We were elected, also, I think, because the country judged, setting one team of men and women against another, that we were the better team, the more experienced, the more compassionate and understanding.

Above all, I believe we were elected because the people of Britain recognised the nature and depth of the challenge we face as a nation.

They realise that the going from now on will be tougher than we have known in this genera­tion. They recognise that this national challenge can be met not by confrontation and divisive conflict, but only by comradeship and co-opera­tion and care and concern.

Our mandate is to ensure that as the going gets tougher and tougher up the hill - as it will - that, in the words of the old Socialist story about the stage-coach going up-hill, the order must go out to the nation … ‘Everybody who is able-bodied, regardless of rank or class, gets out and shoves. But if there are any among us who are unable to play their part through illness, age, infancy or disability, they, and they alone, are free to ride.’

Let it be absolutely clear: the problems we face are not what the Conservatives called ‘the problems of success.’ At home our industries have, for far too long, suffered from under­investment - in new and modern machinery, in the necessary expansion of the growth sectors of our economy.

In the world at large the balance of economic power has fundamentally changed almost before our eyes, particularly the balance of power between those who produce the raw materials of the industrialised world, and those who import and consume them.

In some respects, this was long overdue; the advanced industrial world had benefited at the expense of the primary producers.

But the change that has occurred with so much rapidity has created great inequality between developing countries. Some of them - oil producers, producers of copper and other raw materials - are receiving an uncovenanted benefit. Their balance of payments, their national income and the income of their pro­ducers have been greatly expanded.

But the other developing countries, the countries without the right raw materials, the countries of what is now known as the Fourth World - they have not only gained nothing from the commodity boom, they are actually crippled by all that this means in terms of further burdens on their already unbalanced trade and payments.

The standard of living of their people, already, abysmally low, falls even further, as they have to pay more for the raw materials they need and for their food.

For when the price of oil soared so astrono­mically it not only hit the powerful trading nations of Europe, of America and Japan. Still harder, it hit those Fourth World countries already facing famine, deprivation, disease, premature death, and natural disasters, flood and drought.

For Britain, what the economic crisis means is that oil alone has added an extra £2,500 million on our import bill every year. That is a surcharge of over £2 a week - £2 a week every week - upon every household in this country.

From there we start, and that oil increase came on top of a trade deficit which already approached £2,500 million in 1973. It came when prices were already soaring, in some cases forced upwards by deliberate Conserva­tive Government action. Inflation was not created by the oil crisis; it was aggravated by it to an unprecedented degree.

A year ago, as the country was moved into that disastrous confrontation with the miners, the political battle about inflation was to some extent an argument about wages and prices: which was the causal factor, wages forcing up prices, or prices forcing up wages? Since then, more and more it has been acknowledged that at that time it was prices which gave the twist to the inflationary spiral, with wages, statutorily controlled though they were, struggling to keep pace.

That was why we insisted, in Opposition, not only on stricter price controls of manufactured goods, but on much more effective action to deal with the main items entering into an ordinary family’s budget - above all, food prices and housing. That was why we demanded, in the February election, the introduction of food subsidies on the main essentials.

That was why we fought so bitterly against the so-called prices policy of the Conservative Government. That was why we reversed the Conservative housing policy which, so far from controlling the cost of housing, insisted with the force of law that reluctant local authorities must force up the rents of 5 million families - to say nothing of the action taken against those living in private rented homes.

Think how much more the cost of living of the average family since last February would have risen had we not so acted on food prices and housing.

But, just as we emphasised a year ago that it was prices and rents that were forcing up wage claims, so we warned even then - as we have warned in the two Elections - that as world prices other than oil began to moderate, the inflationary threat here in Britain would come more and more not from external prices but from our own incomes and wages.

In public and private industry now, it is wage costs which threaten to provide a new infla­tionary twist.

There are some - perhaps even within our own movement - who are tempted to ask, ‘Why all this fuss about inflation: why, if we cannot control it, don’t we relax and enjoy it?’

The short answer is that inflation is the enemy of everything we believe in, in this movement.

By its very nature, it is above all the enemy of democratic socialism, of everyone who seeks greater equality, full employment, and social justice.

When the Labour Party and the TUC met to hammer out the terms of its joint document, ‘Economic Policy and the Cost of Living’ - the Social Contract - we agreed from the outset that inflation is fundamentally arbitrary and unfair - a divisive redistribution of wealth and income.

It is a redistribution not according to any Socialist principles we recognise and pursue. Indeed, inflation can, and so often does, benefit the rich at the expense of the poor, because only those with power and financial resources can acquire and manipulate the kind of assets which actually increase in value with inflation.

The less well-off have no such protection from the remorseless squeeze which inflation puts on the cost of feeding and clothing a family, or on the value of a small nest-egg of savings, or on the millions, mainly the old, who are living on fixed incomes.

But inflation is not only capricious and inequitable in terms of redistribution of our national wealth and income. Inflation is the father and mother of unemployment for our people, and of insecurity for their families.

It is an illusion to believe that big money wage settlements protect you from rising prices. They make them rise faster. 

It is an illusion to believe that they are an instrument for maintaining social justice; on the contrary, they destroy social justice.

It is an illusion to believe that they protect you from the loss of a job. They make that loss more likely.

Inflation means that those who are concerned with the social wage, the family protection provided by the social services, those who are battling to create a decent social system, all these are fighting a losing battle because of inflation.

The Welfare State, on which the post-war Labour Government set Britain’s course, has provided, in terms of health, housing, educa­tion, and social security, benefits which are spread throughout the land and through the whole social scale.

Socialists have always preached that a civilised society can be judged above all by the social provision that it makes for the least favoured of our people, the standard of living it provides for those least able to help them­selves.

I am proud to have appointed Britain’s first ever Minister for the Disabled, whose social work through the Chronically Sick and Dis­abled Persons’ Act years ago had already begun to help millions of families and individuals. Everything Alf Morris and his chief, Barbara Castle, and her team, are trying to do in the whole field of social services is undermined by the threat of inflation, as are education and the people’s housing.

The social services, including the health service, are more labour intensive than almost any other sector of our national life. Wage and salary costs are a very high proportion of total costs.

The Social Contract means a fair division of our national resources, the fair sharing of sacrifices. It is not a scramble in which the big battalions, the powerful and wealthy, on both sides of industry, or in finance, or in any sector of the community, can exercise their power in order to get an unfair advantage.

No one should seek to take wealth for themselves which they have not earned, because that wealth will have been put into the national pool by somebody who did work.

For example, during the Stock Exchange panic in August, there were weevils at work, happily making money, out of shares that never belonged to them. The Sunday Times referred to a week of ‘pure senselessness in the stock market’ and went on ‘Bear selling was an important influence last week; men selling shares they do not own to drive the price down so that they can buy them back cheaper a few days later. Well-known merchant banks were at it. And so was at least one syndicate of stockbrokers, of the speculative sort most of us thought were wiped out.’

A day or two later, we read that someone had spread the rumour that a million ICI shares were going to he loaded on to the market and destroy the value. It was untrue and proved to be untrue, but somebody hoped to make a packet, and if they had it would have come from someone else’s sweat and skill and hard work, because these activities were creating and producing nothing.

Using power and ingenuity to avoid taxes also means that other members of the national family are worse off; and it has to be made up by higher taxes or reduced provision for the social services.

When, by selling shares overnight and buying them back the next morning to establish tax losses - the so-called ‘bed and breakfast’ fiddle - jobbers and brokers make a packet for themselves and the Exchequer is deprived of future tax revenue, it is an abuse of a fair society.

One big company was recently reported as scheming one of these bed and breakfast operations - a £30 million deal overnight. Just a couple of ’phone calls. A loss to the Revenue. An additional burden on other taxpayers, people much less well off. I wish it was always so easy for us in Government when money is desperately needed for a really worthwhile cause, like cars for the disabled.

The big battalions may feel they can protect themselves. They can. In the short-term but at a cost to those with less bargaining muscle. Ultimately, it would be at a heavy cost to themselves.

After all our experience in the previous Labour Governments - and the experience of democratic countries - I do not believe that in a democracy statutory control of wages can work for very long. And it cannot work twice. In no time at all you are having to deal with more problems than you ever solved by the statute.

And most of the problems we are facing today on the incomes front are an inheritance from Stage 1 and Stage 2 and Stage 3. Anomalies created by those rigid bureaucratic formulae. Members of our community who had been ignored for years - and for whom we are extending belated social justice - the nurses, the postal workers, workers in metropolitan transport services and, very soon, the teachers. And when our critics in politics, or press - and some of them are the same people - ponti­ficate about the wage rate or the earnings index, let them calculate how much of the increase they complain of represents the cost, the belated cost, of providing for those who had been left behind, and also the costs of the thresholds given statutory power a year ago.

But, Mr Chairman, if the law of the big battalions operates, it could break the Social Contract. Let there be no doubt about that. Then the only choices facing a democratic Government are grave: either deflationary measures involving a reduction in public expenditure, which means cutting the social wage, or an increase in taxation, taxation which, if it meant direct taxation, would be a straight cut in take-home pay, or, if it was by means of indirect taxation, would mean a cut in the purchasing power of the pay that was taken home. And both these remedies would result in unemployment for our people.

None of us, Mr Chairman, joined this Party, devoted our lives to this Party, to make it the Party of unemployment. We reject that solution, emphatically, decisively, once and for all.

But in rejecting it, every one of us carries the responsibility for ensuring that the Social Contract does succeed. Everyone of us. At work, in our constituency parties, in the trade unions.

It is a Contract between Government and people. All the people. It is a Contract under which this Government has pledged itself, as no other Government in British history has pledged itself, to the promotion of social and economic justice in Britain. Social and economic justice between the people and between the regions of our country.

It is a policy for social and economic equality. But it is a policy with obligations, with responsibilities as well as rewards. You cannot pick and choose. It is not a policy from which you can extract the parts you like and reject the parts you do not.

I believe all the British people, whether they like this Government or not, want to see Britain emerge strong and healthy from its present troubles. They all want to know what they can do to help speed the day of a new strength for Britain. What they can all do is to join with us, with the Government, the Party, the TUC, and make certain that the Social Contract succeeds.

Mr Chairman, in the February election, in the months which followed right up to the October election - and since - we have never for one moment disguised from our people that we cannot expect any measurable increase in the average standards of living for two years or more ahead. Yes, of course, there is the proverbial light at the end of the tunnel, when North Sea oil, on the basis of public participa­tion, begins to improve our balance of pay­ments, personal standards of living and the social wage.

But what we cannot afford to do is to mort­gage that North Sea income before we have it. For too long, complacent British governments encouraged our people to live on the investment of past decades, living on our fathers and prejudicing the future of our children. Time and again governments have not been prepared to set aside, out of current production, the seed corn for the investment of the future.

It is a charge against both major parties that, taking the whole period since the war, as well as in the years of depression before that, we have failed to invest adequately in strengthening our industrial capital and competitiveness.

We must not, in the years ahead, so load the burden on to the future that those vast treasures around our shores, first of the North Sea and then in the Celtic Seas, are mortgaged before they are ever brought to shore.

Out of its current earnings, the nation must provide for investment in the future. Investment is not for us, not for the nation just a matter of stocks and shares. Investment is new factories, and the services those factories need; investment is new pits to exploit the vast new seams of coal that have been discovered; it is new steelworks. It is public investment and it is private investment. It, and it alone, can provide new jobs and secure our people’s prosperity.

If we fail to tackle this problem of investment, then failure can become endemic, and fatal to all our hopes for the nation we hand on to our children.

The policies on which we were elected, the Manifestos of February and October, provide the best hope of a real drive for productive investment in British industry for a generation. For the conventional financial wisdom has failed the nation.

The Conservative solution was simple and, in its simplicity, totally ineffective.

The Conservative solution was based first on a reduction in taxation on wealthier people, so that with less pressure on their standard of living, they would save and invest more. Some­times they invested and sometimes they didn’t. When they did, their idea of investment was not to finance the production of new machine tools or factories, but to buy shares which gave the hope of the greatest profit, not those which strengthened the industrial base of the economy.

But the second part of the Conservative policy, of course, was that panic financial spree of the previous Government, the ending of capital controls and the release of money through the Bank of England’s ‘Competition and Credit Controls’ Paper of May 1971.

The hope was no doubt that, combined with the tax remissions, the money would flow into industrial investment. But instead some was invested in property in Europe - it has not done very well, some of it - a large proportion flowed into property speculation at home which has now gone wrong and which, more than any other factor, has created the current Doomsday psychosis in the City. Particularly in the banking and insurance sectors.

And throughout the years of that policy, manufacturing industry was the Cinderella, neglected by investors and badly hit by rocket­ing interest rates.

So reduced taxation on wealthier people, the printing of money which led to that massive misdirection of investment capital - these failed. But not only these. When Britain entered the Common Market on those futile terms so lightly entered into by our predecessors, this was widely hailed as providing a sure and guaranteed incentive to the biggest spate of investment in this century.

At the annual Guildhall speech in 1971 my predecessor said, I quote:

'The prospect of free access to the European market, combined with a revival of demand at home, cries out for a Major programme of investment in industrial expansion and modernisation... Let industry now take the long-term view of our future in Europe. We now have the chance to bring about the regeneration and re-equipping of British industry. We must make ourselves the most modern country in the Community.'

That was Mr. Heath in 1971.

Two and a half years later when we took office, industrial investment was still below the 1970 peak attained and bequeathed to them when we left office.

My main message to Conference today is this: that the future of this country, of the standard of living of our people, perhaps of democracy itself, depend upon the effort we put into investment in industry, public and private.

This is not a new problem.

My favourite quotation - I have even put it on the title page of a book I wrote not long ago - is from the last ever speech that Aneurin Bevan made in the House of Commons before he was taken ill, the speech of 3 November 1959.

‘There is,’ he said,

'one important problem facing representa­tive parliamentary government in the whole of the world where it exists. It is being asked to solve a problem which so far it has failed to solve: that is, how to reconcile parliamen­tary popularity with sound economic plan­ning.'

And he went on,

'I would describe the central problem falling upon representative government in the Western world as how to persuade the people to forego immediate satisfactions in order to build up the economic resources of the country… How can we persuade the ordinary man and woman that it is worth­while making sacrifices in their immediate standards or foregoing substantial rising standards to extend fixed capital equipment throughout the country?'

That was Aneurin Bevan in 1959. Fifteen years later - and we paid the price of what he was forecasting in 1970 - the problem has so far remained unsolved.

Mr. Chairman, you and other colleagues have made clear how faithfully the Labour Govern­ment has adhered to the Manifesto we pub­lished in February, even in a minority Parlia­ment, and how clearly also the legislative programme for the first session of the new Parliament, set out in the Queen’s Speech, follows the main priorities of the October Manifesto. What I think many delegates even will be surprised to note is how much of that programme, put before the nation for a five-year Parliament, is in our programme for implementation in the first year of this Parliament. Our social priorities, public participation in North Sea oil, public ownership of land, aircraft and shipbuilding and a host of other measures. This session.

And our electoral success, I believe, is owed not just to our faithfulness over those six or seven months in carrying out our Manifesto, but to the relevance and breadth of the policies set out in the Manifesto. And this, in its turn, is a tribute to the work which thousands of our people, in consultation with every affiliated organization, every constituency, the Parlia­mentary Labour Party, the Executive, under­took in those Opposition years.

I believe that our Manifesto - and that means our Parliamentary and Government programme - is the answer to Nye Bevan’s insis­tence on sound economic planning providing the industrial investment we need and on which we are acting as a matter of urgency.

I do not intend to deal in these closing minutes with the economic and financial inheritance of last March, or what has been done to deal with the problem in, now three successive Budgets. But the Chancellor in last month’s Budget made clear that in his deter­mination first - this is one of his difficulties he said - in his determination first to improve the cash position of industrial companies, and then to improve industrial investment, he was inhibited, the Government was inhibited, because he had to act by generalised measures without the more selective measures that were required.

As the economists would say, he could only act in a macro sense, when micro and selective measures were also needed. And in his Budget speech the Chancellor stressed in particular, as I stress again today, the relevance of the National Enterprise Board and of Planning Agreements with the major industrial com­panies; and the purpose being to ensure com­pliance with national objectives, particularly investment, prices, productivity, regional em­ployment, exports and import saving, product development, industrial relations and con­sumers’ interests. It is all in the book, or it is in the White Paper and it will soon be in the legislation.

The economic establishment represented by our opponents inside and outside Parliament continue to demonstrate their economic illi­teracy by their ideological attacks on the National Enterprise Board. But we have seen it all before. The Industrial Reorganization Corporation of 1966 was resisted as few measures have been resisted in the post-war world by those very same opponents, the Con­servative Party and the Conservative Press. By 1970 the IRC was acclaimed as a great advance in economic institutions, to the point where even Mr. John Davies recommended its con­tinuation, in 1970, only to be met by a doctri­naire decision at a higher level requiring him to introduce repealing legislation. How often even the Conservatives have wished that IRC had remained in existence.

We are therefore reinstituting IRC as one of the roles of the National Enterprise Board. A Cabinet Committee under my Chairmanship last week approved final instructions to Parliamentary draftsmen for the drafting of the Bill which I hope will be before Parliament early in the New Year and which Tony Benn will carry through Parliament with the united support of the Parliamentary Labour Party. (Applause) This measure enables the Government to pro­mote Planning Agreements and to establish the National Enterprise Board.

This is what I have been leading up to all this last half hour. It is in this, I believe, that we have found the right approach - which for a generation we failed to find - to the problem of securing enough investment and investment where it is most needed in the form in which it is needed.

This is a new - I do not think people have recognised this yet, including a lot of our own people - and selective instrument for creating and financing investment where more gener­alised financial policies of the kind I have described have failed. And where goes state money for investment goes also public account­ability and an appropriate public share in the equity.

In place of hit-or-miss financial measures such as we had from 1972 to 1973, based on vague hopes that somehow finance that has been created will find its way by some magic process into buildings and machinery and research and development - in place of all that, we shall inject public money, case by case, and plant by plant, where it is needed for exports or modernisation and to create new jobs in the regions.

Some of it will go inevitably to save essential firms and industries in danger of collapse in the free-for-all jungle that we inherited. Some of it will go to firms which have no difficulty about survival but can survive only at the expense of expansion, or by postponing essential modernisations or by ruthlessly cutting down essential means of production. Some of it will go to create new ventures, on the basis of joint partnership with Government.

All of it will go on the basis which other democratic countries have followed, that where there flows the regenerative public capital there goes with it a corresponding degree of public ownership and control. (Applause)

Good Socialist doctrine, yes; it is good capitalist doctrine too. When the City of London puts its money in, it usually wants a corresponding say in the business, in the profits of the business, and in the control of the business.

The life-giving investment British industry needs, and of which it has been so long starved, will, I believe, do more than anything else - except success in the battle against inflation itself - to overcome the crisis we are facing.

In doing this we shall make industry more vigorous, more profitable, more up-to-date and competitive, more able to benefit from the introduction of a greater measure of industrial democracy and worker participation than we have ever previously sought to create in this country.

This is the real answer to the cacophony of ignorance and malevolence of our opponents and the ideology masquerading as economic theory.

They say that public money invested in industrial assets, for the purpose of modernising those assets, is a charge on the taxpayer, or that economic stability will be endangered by borrowing. But we are warned daily that industrialists are scaling down their investment intentions, and that there will be a drying up of private borrowing anyway.

Those who argue in this way are, in fact, pre-Keynes, pre-John Maynard Keynes. While we have moved on from Keynes, vintage 1936, our opponents argue as though he never even existed. He said when private investment plans are inadequate there must be public investment to secure full employment. What he had in mind was public works, roads, sewage and drainage.

That is why I claim the National Enterprise Board is the biggest leap forward in economic thinking, as well as in economic policy, since the war. For where private investment falls away, or even if it is not falling is on a scale far too small to ensure a high level of employ­ment and modernisation, when that is the posi­tion public investment is enlisted.

Investment, not to produce goods which our customers do not want or cannot afford, but to make the goods with which we can pay our way in the world and modernise Britain.

This is where we move the nation forward by a whole generation in our thinking and in our policy. And public investment, in deference to the late John Maynard Keynes, is to be mobilised, not to turn engineers into road workers, or for constructing drainage and sewage, but specifically directed in terms of the machinery, the plant, the research and develop­ment we so urgently need for the regeneration of British industry and the creation of a sharper cutting edge in the markets of the world,

So, Mr. Chairman, at the outset of this Parliament the Labour Government, carrying as I believe the confidence of the nation, embarks on the greatest task any Government has faced in this country, certainly in peace time.

For a year or two, I repeat, unable to hold out any hope of a general increase in living standards, but determined to ensure that sacrifices shall be fairly shared, and the burdens borne by the broadest backs.

A Government determined that we shall no longer try to live on the production made by previous generation, and still less to mortgage the future which we want our people and our children to enjoy in full measure, as the treasures around our shores begin to raise our living standards.

A Government determined to ensure that the social income, the social wage, shall rise within the priorities we have set, priorities related to, but limited by, the increase in our production we are asking from our people.

A Government determined, even at a time when the increase in resources is constricted by external action, constricted as never before in the post-war world, on a clearly directed in­jection of investment into productive industry, to under-write our export drive and our industrial expansion alike, and not merely determined but now ready with the machinery through the National Enterprise Board, the Planning Agreements, and the rest of our policy, to make it a reality.

Mr. Chairman, we have a five-year Parliament ahead of us. Five years of challenge. Five years of Labour Government, with the regeneration of British industry at the heart of its programme.

It is a programme for the regeneration of Britain.

It involves restraints and sacrifices.

It means discipline and hard work through­out, in better times as well as in tough times.

It means everybody, all of us in Government, in the Party, and throughout the nation, striving to make sure that the Social Contract works.

But just as the burdens and sacrifices will be shared at the beginning, when the going is hard, so the future benefits will be shared with fairness and social justice among all our people. Shared according to socialist principles. Only a Labour Government can, and only this Labour Government - with your support - will carry those principles into action.

When next year I again present the Parlia­mentary Report to Conference you will see that we will have gone further, further than anyone - anyone in the October election, further perhaps than anyone here in this hall this week - would have expected in turning into reality in one single year so much of the policy laid down in our Manifesto. (Prolonged applause)"
10165,"Helmut Schmidt, Chancellor Inauguration Speech",https://www.nytimes.com/1974/12/01/archives/schmidt-urges-british-to-back-market-vote-embarrasses-wilson.html,Helmut Schmidt,Chancellor (Germany),Inauguration Speech,1974,,"LONDON, Nov. 30—Chancellor Helmut Schmidt of West Germany appeared before the Labor party conference here today and urged Britain to remain in the Common Market.

Speaking on the day after the governing party's annual conference had embraced a strong anti‐Market resolution opposed by Prime Minister Harold Wilson's Cabinet, Chancellor Schmidt likened his appearance to that of a man who sought to convince members of the Salvation Army of the virtues of drinking.

“Your comrades on the Continent want you to stay,” Mr. Schmidt said. “They believe that it is in their interest and in, yours to remain.”

Mixed Concern and Humor

The speech by Mr. Schmidt, a fraternal delegate” representing the Socialists of West Germany, was closely watched in view of the threats by some anti‐Market delegates to walk out None did, however, largely because Mr. Schmidt spoke in favor, of the Market with a mixture of concern, humor and smiles.

“I'm not here to interfere with your decision on the Market” Mr. Schmidt said. “And, of course, I am not going to shoot from the hip at high noon.”

Mr. Schmidt, who won loud applause, stressed the need for cooperation to meet world‐wide energy and economic crises. He said he recognized that the Common Market provided a fair share of misgivings. But, he added: “The advantages of the European Economic Community have greater weight than the stresses and burdens.

“It's not all that difficult being a politician in Europe,” he said with a smile. “All you have to do is satisfy the farmers, the unions and a few others and still manage to get re‐elected.”

Vote Embarrasses Wilson

Mr. Wilson, who sat on the platform as Mr. Schmidt spoke, had been embarrassed by the anti‐Market rebellion at the conference. He and his ministers suffered a severe rebuff in the voting on the issue. The majority demanded a price for continuing membership that no British Government could possibly win from its European partners.

Moreover, the conference delegates agreed to hold a special meeting next year, sometime just before flit promised referendum on whether Britain should withdraw from Europe. While recommendations from such meetings are not binding on the Government, they produce tension and division within party ranks.

The ultimate decision on whether Britain remains in the Market hinges on the outcome of the referendum, now expected next spring after the end of negotiations on changes in the community sought by the Wilson Government.

Withdrawal on Any Terms

There are Increasing signs, however, that the Labor Government has come to the conclusion that pulling out of the Market would pose more dangers for Britain than remaining within it. Mr. Schmidt and his, aides have said privately that British officials have made it clear that Britain would remain.

But at this week's conference, held in a hall near Parliament, many delegates stressed that they favored, withdrawal whatever the new terms. The “'approved antiMarket resolution, for example, called for revisions on the Market's basic treaty, a move all Community members would resist.

The resolution also called for the right of the British Parliament to reject any Market orders or directions, to limit the flow of workers into Britain, to determine its own taxation poiicy and to nationalize kny company operating here.

At some point, Mr. Wilson's Cabinet will have to decide whether to recommend a “yes” or “no” vote to the British—or to remain neutral. A noncommittal stance would not prevent ministers from campaigning on the Market issue but it could prevent an open Cabinet split and resignations.

After his speech, Mr. Schmidt conferred with Prime Minister Wilson on a range of topics, including inflation, oil prices and the Common Market summit meeting scheduled for Dec. 9 and 10 in Paris."
10172,"Abdelaziz Bouteflika, PGA Inauguration Speech",http://undocs.org/en/A/PV.2351,Abdelaziz Bouteflika,President of the General Assembly,Inauguration Speech,1974,,"3. The TEMPORARY PRESIDENT (interpretation from French); I trust this Assembly will be indulgent of me if, transgressing the traditional rules of reserve, I yield to a natural impulse to tell you of my recent experience, and I should like at once to thank you from the bottom of my heart. 4. The task of a President is not easy when he refuses to seek refuge in an unimaginative attitude. This might give one a feeling of false confidence and of deceptive equilibrium. We have in fact all elected to respond in conformity with the ideals of the Charter of the United Nations to the fundamental questions posed by the urgency of the affairs of the moment, which weigh so heavily on the fate ofthe international community. 5. The pending problems, by reason of their number and gravity, and the violation of the fundamental rights of peoples in the Mediterranean and in the mountain ranges of the Andes, which endanger peace and security throughout the world, make complacency impossible and demand constant watchfulness. 6. Now, even those peoples who are far removed from the decision-making centres, because of their increased collective awareness, bring to bear their full influence on the fate of mankind, thus making an original and positive contribution wh;'z rejecting outmoded concepts and patterns of domination. 7. It is in the area ofdecolonization that this evolving process is particularly apparent. Were it necessary to give an illustration of the foregoing, the problems of Palestine and South Africa would undoubtedly be the most striking examples. In fact, the consistent manner in which the General Assembly has dealt with the affairs of Palestine and South Africa, and the decisions taken in regard to their respective status, bear witness to the progress achieved in the realization of the principles of the Charter and give proof of the determination of the Assembly fully to discharge its responsibilities, with all the seriousness and urgency demanded by the plight of peoples who have been kept unjustly away from the mainstream of the international community. 8. The effects of decolonization are already noticeable as we look at the composition of the Assembly, with the admission of Guinea-Bissau to the United Nations and the expected entry of Mozambique, Sao Tome and Principe, Cape Verde and Angola. This last country is at present living through tragic times. The case of Angola is, moreover, symptomatic of a new imperialist offensive in that part of Africa, where the liberation of the peoples of South Africa, Zimbabwe and Namibia is hind,~red by a whole series of acts of political, economic and military interference in an attempt to thwart their aspiration to freedom and independence. 9. To oppose those aspirations is to assume the responsibility of confronting the African peoples with new challenges. In any event; the ideal of liberation will triumph in the end. The will of peoples has always determined the course ofhistory and ifproofis required it is clearly to be found in \.he history of the peoples of Indo-China. 10. It was precisely in the Indo-Chinese peninsula that the impotence of the United ""Nations to master or to ancitipate events was clearly shown. And yet, in this case, the elements of the solution to the problem were very much within the grasp of the United Nations, which could have affirmed more clearly its mission of peace had it not been paralysed by an obstructive policy the rule ofwhich is to use the United Nations rather than serve its objectives ofjustice and progress. Be that as it may, we must pay a tribute to the contribution made by the peoples of Indo-China to the consolidation of international security, particularly at a time when they are getting read"" to bring to peace the greatness of spirit and moving genius which in war have aroused the respect and admiration of all. This new face of Indo-China, its appeal for co-operation, its will to participate in the efforts of the community in order to create a more just and humane world, deserve the full consideration of the entire international community. 11. The return of the legitimate Cambodia, so long excluded from this body, which I have the honour to welcome on behalf of the Assembly, is a sharp reminder of the opportunities of playing its true part missed by the Organization and enjoins me to bring solemnly to the Assembly's attention the past mistakes which led to the deadlocks of which we are all aware and compels me to request that you ponder the possibility of their recurrence which would inevitably lead to the same difficulties. 12. By the defiance of the will of the international community to welcome as full Members the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam and the Republic of South Viet Nam, the Organization is being deprived once again of its vocation of universality and the possibility offulfilling its first duty, that of assisting that martyred region ofthe world to heal the wounds of a devastating war. 13. The interest ofthe United Nations demands this, as it demands, moreover, that we pursue our ~fforts to create propitious conditions for the peaceful reunification of Korea. We hope that the days of rancour are oyer and that lucidity, which generates hope, may open the way for the great meeting ofthe peoples. 14. On the solution of the political problems we are to confront depends the credibility of this Organization and, therefore, its power to give to its decisions all the weight they need to bring about qualitative changes in an ever more interdependent world. 15. The United Nations in fact has arrived at a crossroads in its orientation, and, since its very destiny is at stake, we must together seek out common and appropriate lines on which to ensure its reconversion, with a view to overcoming the political and economic uncertainties of our time and reducing antagonisIns. 16. True, the machinery with which our Organization is endowed does not work well. The institutional imbalance between the principal organs of the United Nations and the hypertrophy ofpowersinherent in abuses of the use of the veto have accentuated this anomaly to the extent that the balance in their relations as originally defined is upset and no longer corresponds to the reality of the new forces that have emerged since 1945. The world has witnessed the emergence of forces whose constant will has been to propose for the good of all solutions capable of doing away with the serious distortions affecting all international political and economic relations. In this connexion the twenty-ninth session, like the seventh special session, is the result of a long and patient search for a dialogue designed to overcome the contradictions, too long ignored, in various international meetings. 17. The cohesion and the careful solidarity of the developing world have imposed a global vision of the problems of the world and paved the way for a new world order. For their part, the wealthy countries appear today to recognize that the maintenance of their own peace demands that the arguments of their less privileged partners concerning the necessary reform of a system in a critical condition no longer be rejected. It was precisely this attitude which made it possible for first the Declaration and Programme of Action on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order [resolutions 3201 (S-VI) and 3202 (S-Vl)] and then the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States [resolution 328/ (XXIX)] to appear. Nevertheless, we still have to promote political conditions favourable to the establishment of a new international economic order. 18. Perhaps we should also say that the countries of the third world, which possess neither military nor economic power, today have the historical privilege of contributing by their moral force to the realization of the ideals 01 the Charter. 19. The wr- ..... of the thirtieth session of the General Assembly begins with the questions included on an especially heavy agenda, while the activities of the United Nations have certainly known no respite, since the seventh special session has just ended and the twenty-ninth session closed only a moment ago. This increase in work which, I am sure, is felt by all will in any event have the merit of showing more clearly what the various positions on the questions before us are and what course future debates will follow. But, since we are faced with the burning problems of today, we shall be led to confirm this will to reflect the changes that are shaping the new face of mankind. We should like to believe this, and we hope that we shall embark on this course.

10174,"Gaston Thorn, PGA Inauguration Speech",http://undocs.org/en/A/31/PV.1,Gaston Thorn,President of the General Assembly,Inauguration Speech,1975,,"3. The TEMPORARY PRESIDENT (interpretation from French): The international conferences which have been held with particular frequency since the beginniIlg of the thirtieth session have made their mark on international life and have struck world public opinion both by the number of participants and the peoples represented, and by the impact they may have had.
4. I am wondering whether we are not entitled to see in this multiplication of international contacts unequivocal proof of the fact that international co-opernt!on has assumed new dimensions and that mankind has determinedly and defmitively embarked on a course of dialogue, thanks to which we can harmonize everyone's interests. 
5. The movement towards the building of a new 'Yorld . which to its groat credit the United Nations has fostered and directed is a powerful Gause for hope, peace and progress, provided, however, that the effort made is followed up within a reasonable period oftime by decisions which can be reflected !n tangible advantages for an men, because, in order to assist ail those who are afflicted by the many scourges of today's world, we can no longer confme ourselves to speeches or to solemn procl~.uations of the right of an human beings to existence, to food and to a dignified md free life. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights has unequivocally set a goal that is ambitious but one we have all committed ourselves to attain. The International Co\';:nants on Human Rights constitute a real step forward, albeit a timorous one, in the right direction, but a great deal remains to be done.
6. As long as practical measures have not been taken in each of our States to respect, and to ensure respect for, the rlghtll of each individual, our words, void of sense, will remain lies and hypocrisy.
7. It is becoming more and more unacceptable for us to invest annually some $300 billion in the arms race while we do not dev!lte even a tenth of that amount to the struggle against under-development, which, however, condemns-and I am sorry to quotlll these fIgUres, which are increasing dangerously-1.2 billion human beings to overwhelming poverty, the majority of them being, according to the Inte~tional Labou.r Office, totally destitute.
8. How indeed can we properiy ensure the security ofthe world when we are in this way allowing to develop one of the greatest sources of frustration, tension and conflict? 1bis is one of the essential concerns of our SecretaryGimeral.
9. It is to be hoped that we can find in these figures, which testify to a tremendous injustice, a silent injustice suffered by so many men, the necessary motivation to accelerate our work in an obviously complex field namely, that of disarmament, confining ourselves to its priority aspects in order to finally accelerate our work in an obviously complex field, namely, that of disarmament, confIDing ourselves to its priority upecu in order fmally to achieve the cessation and then, it is hoped, the reversal of a trend which is a threat to the whole of mankind. No argument about the balance of power, no commercial considerations, should influence any one of us or distract us from our great responsibility .
10. Economically, the world situation today is of concern but perhaps it is encouraging at the same time. It is disturbing because of the persistence of too high a rate of inflation side by side with massive unemployment. However, it is encouraging because the problem of aR equitable distribution of the world's wealth, including the resources of the sea, among all nations and for the benefit of all mankind remain~ the focus of our debate. At each new international m"".:ting, wt.tther at Vancouver, Nairobi, Paris or New York, new momentum is given to the creation of a new economic and social order, an international order marked increasingly by justice and solidarity. 11. No one has the right to oppose this just redressing among eations of the balance of economic interests and arrangements which have so far turned out to be inadequate for ~nsurini a significant measure of development, particularJ.:; in developing countries, which for far too long have suffered from foreign economic domination. 12. It was at the seventh special session that the General Assembly, by choosing the path of reason between confrontation and conciliation, made it possible to lay the foundations for the search for a negotiated solution. The Conference on ~nternational Economic Co-operation in Paris has been able precisely to defme the positions of its participants before it embarks on the production of tangible results, I hope, in the near future. The fourth session of ta'le United Nations Conference on Trade and Development IUNCTADj,IN the great discussion gro"""" of industrialized and developing countries, ended not without SUCl;eSS and establimed procedures which should lead the parties to draw closer togeth\\r on the heart of the problem
, 13. At the thirty-farst session it is important to undertake an evaluation of the efforts made over a year alld to establish the necessary guidelines to facilitate within our existing structures a crystallization of the progress-already achieved. 14. At the same time, along with this necessary transformation of economic relations throughout the world, we welcome the idea of introducing into developing countri.es autonomous structures and new instruments which could guarantee balanced regional development and create authentic markets which would take better account of the needs and local conditions. IS. In this regard, I should like to pay a particular tribute to the non-aligned countries, which, as was recently stressed at the meeting in Colombo,' will be a driving force in the search for a new political and economic order to the extent that they are persevering and are able to maintain unity and display creative imagination.
16. Whether it be international or regional, economic growth is not, we must stress, an end i.'1.itself. To have some sense it must be of benefit to all countries and all nationals of those countries.
17. However, with regard to the fair redistribution of national wealth and income, we must note that unacceptable privileges and inadmissible social and economic gaps survive in almost all parts of the world. In order truly to improve the conditions of all, and particularly the conditions of the most underprivileged, we can no longer delay putting int'J effect national deve!opm~nt strategies. Whether it be a matter of social restructuring, the implementation of agrarian programmes or the bringing about of urban reform, all these measures are inevitable and of absolute priority
18. More than 30 years after the foundation of the United Nations, our Organization must regrettably register a new serious setback to the tolerance which the Charter calls on all peoples to observe. For almost a year now a fierce and murderous civil war hBs gone on in Lebanon. Two communities are destroying each other with incredible ferocity. The world is, alas, watching this carnage, powerless and shocked by the spread of so much violence and of so much hatred.
19. I feel myself that the General Assembly must call on the different oppoaing parties to renounce their recourse to Violence, so that they may without delay and without preliminary conditions conduct serious negotiations.
20. It is a fact that what is now happening in Lebanon is merely the latest bloody stage in the tragic·conflict in the Middle East which has engaged our Organization since its foundation. Can we continue to refuse to give a definite and objective reply to the Palestinian people who, for many years, have been subjected to massacre and to a life of wandering and misfortune that only the founders of Israel had known before it?
21. We cannot deny to this people the very thing that we have granted to the other, what every people is entitled to, namely, the right to existence and to a country of its own.
22. If the parties involved in this conflict rely on the work of the Security Council, and once they are given a guarantee to live in peace, that is, within secure and recogrtized boundaries, they should at last be able to meet openly to work out the means for a peaceful settlement which it would be vain, indeed irresponsible, to delay any longer
23. In southern Africa, frontier incidents proliferate, and bloody riots, which fmt broke out in Soweto and were followed by frrece repression, are spreading throughout the region. Under the pressure of an increasingly impatient public opinion, and faced by growing opposition at home and abroad, the white minority governments can see the last ramparts of their oppressive regimes collapsing about them. Defying all the resolutions of the United Nations,
 
24. In Cyprus, new negotiations between the communities have still not led to any real progress towards an enduring settlement. It is desirable that the parties concerned should be given further and serious encouragement so that, under the auspices of the Secretary-General, they Carl come to grips with the fundamental problem in a serious and constructive manner. 25. Internationai terrorism and violence have during the past weeks and months assumed, we must all admit, alanning proportions. In its most revolting form, namely the hijacking of irlrcraft and the taking of hostages, this phenomenon not only increasingly endangers the lives of many completely innocent individuals, but also seriously threatens the security of all our States wiiliout a single exception. No State can benefit from allowing this anarchic disturbance of international life to continue. It-is therefore essential tlIat this Assembly should fulfd its special responsibilities in the matter and succeed in adopting urgent and energetic steps
26. Instead of dealing with the problem of terrorism as a whole, the moment may have .:ome to concentrate our immediate efforts on one aspect of terrorism, tL most important aspect-tlIat of defending the most innocent victims by taking decisive action against ilie seizing of hostages.
27. In a few moments, the General Assembly will proceed to the election of the person who will preside over the debates during the coming w.;eks and months. I feel sure that you will elect to this office someone whose competence for such a task will need no confmnation and who will, witll exceptional lucidity, successfully carry out a task which is often difficult and sometimes trying. I hope too, and in so doing I am honestly confessing my own snort-cornings, that he will be able to maintain, for the numerous tasks that await us, a discipline and a level of debl'.te which have often been lacking in t1Ie past. The import.ance and urgency of those tasks are worthy of the prestipe and universal character of the Organization which I hope shall shortly be happy and able to strengthen and consolidate.

10175,"James Callaghan, PM Inauguration Speech",http://www.britishpoliticalspeech.org/speech-archive.htm?speech=174,James Callaghan,Prime Minister (United Kingdom),Inauguration Speech,1976,,"Mr. Chair­man, comrades it is indeed an honour to stand before you today as Leader of our Party and to present to you the report of the Parliamentary Labour Party.

My first words must be a tribute to the man who led us for 13 years, in good times and in bad, never faltering and never losing heart. He led us into five elections and he won four of them. Now he has decided to retire from the Leadership, but not from active public life - unchallenged and finally undefeated. The Conservatives never could master him. Indeed, to tell the truth, I think the National Executive gave him much more trouble than the Tories ever did! But quite apart from his well-known qualities as an out­standing Party Leader and a long-to-be­-remembered Prime Minister, countless rank and file members in our Movement, whose names will never hit the headlines, know him for his personal kindliness, for his complete lack of self-importance and for his generosity. He is, in the true sense of the word, a ‘comrade.’ I hardly know which of his many achievements will rank highest. But if he were asked - and I have not asked him - I have a suspicion that he would place among the things he really values his success in overcoming opposition and doubts and carrying through to a permanent place in our educational system, the Open University.

All of us in public life, whether it be ward secretary or Prime Minister, know that we can­not do our best work unless we have the con­tinuous, unfailing support and understanding of our wives. Any tribute to Harold would be incomplete without us expressing our affection to Mary also. Harold and Mary, Conference salutes you both. (Applause)

This annual report, I am bound to warn you, will miss his whiplash and his wit. All I can do is to follow his electoral example and lead you to victory in four elections out of the next five. (Applause) All aspirants to the Party Leadership, look out.

There now exists a broad framework of toler­ance and comradeship in the Party. Differences of opinion, strongly held, there will be and they will be passionately argued this week. But in a democratic socialist party there is no monopoly of revealed truth. Each of us knows that he has something to learn from the others.

Let me start by expressing my sincere appreciation - and I ask Conference to do so too - to my ministerial and parliamentary col­leagues for their unflagging hard work during the last year. It has been a tough year. For long months we governed without an overall par­liamentary majority. Sometimes we had to rely on colleagues who should have been in hospital or at home in bed, who risked their health to be Present in the House of Commons to see that Labour’s programme was carried through. And you know that it has been carried through. Take this Session’s Parliamentary Bills: ship­building nationalisation; aircraft nationalisation; tied cottages; comprehensive education; pay beds; all these are straight out of the Manifesto. All were opposed line by line by the Tories, all were fought for in the House of Commons by the Parliamentary Labour Party. Sometimes I think those who ask us to stick to the Manifesto are a little selective in their reading of what it con­tains. It was a collective and united effort, but let me thank the two men who had the final respon­sibility of making sure that the members were always - or at least, almost always - in the right place at the right time, the two Chief Whips, Bob Mellish and Michael Cocks. (Applause)

Comrades, there is a line of poetry which is a good line for socialists, even if it was not intended to be:

A man’s reach should exceed his grasp
Or what’s a Heaven for?

While our Conference will constantly reach towards new territory it gives us also a chance to put into perspective what we have done. I ask you all to read the outstanding check list that was reproduced in Labour Weekly a few weeks ago. The remarkable thing is not what we have failed to do, but how much has been carried out before we have reached even the half-way stage of this Parliament.

Nor were we elected on a false or a fake per­spective. Let me remind those who wish us to stick to the Manifesto what its opening words were: ‘Britain faces its most dangerous crisis since the war. 

The Manifesto went on to describe the worst world recession since the 1930’s, the five-fold increase in oil prices, an ever-narrowing industrial base and a level of economic performance which had been in steady decline, compared with our major competitors, for almost a generation. It is all there to read – ‘the most danger­ous crisis since the war.’

We followed a government whose failure to understand the trade unions led them into con­flict and confrontation, and which inevitably crashed in the chaos of the three-day working week. Labour was elected to heal that terrible wound which Tory obstinacy had inflicted on the nation: to replace conflict by partnership, confrontation by co-operation. We knew this was the only way for the country. The British people knew it. Our critics at home and our friends abroad knew it. Even the Tories in their own hearts knew it. There is no better way. So we repealed the Industrial Relations Act. We passed into law the new Trade Union and Labour Relations Act. We put on the statute book an Act to protect employment. We passed an Act to safeguard health and safety at work. We have established the new Advisory, Concili­ation and Arbitration Service for both sides of industry to use. Taken together these measures have given us a framework for industrial rela­tions which has enabled us to rebuild confidence between the trade unions and the Government. It has served Britain well. Consider the improvement in relations on the workshop floor. The number of days lost through industrial dis­putes this year is the lowest for any comparable period since 1967. And the number of disputes is lower than at any time since 1953. That should be the headline news; that is what the world should be hearing about Britain.

At a time when our foreign competitors and, even more important, our customers are ready to believe the worst, I say to the world that this Government has created an industrial framework based on voluntary methods that can serve as a model to anyone throughout the rest of the world. It should be used; we cannot afford not to do so.

But industrial relations is not just a matter of avoiding strikes, important though that is. That is a negative approach. Britain’s present economic position demands a positive approach: a new spirit of co-operation in indus­try, yes, co-operation between employers and trade unionists, changes of attitude on both sides. As I go around - and I do this a lot more these days than I used to - I find more and more active trade unionists, not theoreticians, but active trade unionists on the shop floor, recog­nising that they share a joint responsibility in their place of work. The ordinary worker is get­ting more and more outspoken in his opposition to the small bands of disrupters in industry. Where management is enlightened it, too, sees the need to change its attitude. ‘Theirs not to reason why’ is no more a recipe for industrial success than it was for military.

Now we look for further progress on two fronts. First, the Government is awaiting the report of the Bullock Committee on Industrial Democracy. When I visited the Federal Repub­lic of Germany a little earlier this year, Chancel­lor Helmut Schmidt arranged a meeting which I could attend between members of the Bullock Committee which included some delegates to this conference - notably Jack Jones and Clive Jenkins, as well as David Lea of the TUC and others - and their German opposite numbers who already have 25 years’ experience of worker participation. The Bullock Committee will reach its own conclusions and present them to the Government. But I want to say that I came away from that meeting with the German Chancellor and the representatives of German employers and German workers convinced that the introduction of a system of industrial demo­cracy into British industry must be given high priority by the Government when the Bullock Committee has reported. (Applause)

Second, we should like to see much faster progress on the question of Planning Agree­ments. So far there is a marked reluctance on industry’s part, on management’s part, to enter into Planning Agreements. Perhaps it is a reflec­tion of the ‘theirs but to do and die’ mentality that I have referred to. Some people - I have heard it expressed here - would like to see these agreements made compulsory. I am always a little dubious about the long-term success of shot-gun marriages. We have to convince the management of our larger firms and industries that Planning Agreements are in their interests too: that they will be a major factor in encouraging the productivity and efficiency so vitally needed. Our offer of co-operation extends to industry also.

It is not by accident that I decided to begin this report by discussing the Government’s attitude to industrial relations and industrial co­operation. Nor have I done so just to show what a hash the Conservative Government made of it. I start with this because until there is agreement on the place of the human being in our industrial society, we shall push and pull at the economic levers in vain. We have expected too much from the economic mechanisms and we have, paid insufficient attention to the most important component of all - the human element.

The worker’s relationship with his tools, his integration with his working environment, is the most important unresolved problem in our com­plex industrial society today. We have a people who are better educated, better informed, who have escaped from the deference of my youth and who now look to Government, to employers and to the trade unions to provide a framework and an environment that befits their higher status.

This Conference decided again yesterday, two and a half years after our election, that there is still no better way forward than the Social Contract to give life to this concept. That is as true for the employers as it is for the workers. Does any employer nowadays assert, if he ever did, that he preferred the days of Tory confrontation? Does anyone believe that unem­ployment will be brought down faster under the Tories? Does anyone think that with their sorry record of conflict the Tories could have halved the inflation rate over the last rate? Does anyone know what Tory economic policy really is? Do they advocate incomes policy or a free-for-all? Which is it - either, neither or both? No-one knows. Does anyone know whether the Tories would reflate or deflate? They talk of cutting Government spending. Does anyone know what more they would cut? Have they told us? They talk of cutting taxes. Whose taxes? Perhaps we can guess, but have they told us? Do we know? Would the tax cuts be larger or smaller than the spending cuts? Would the budget deficit be larger or smaller; does anyone know? Does any­one know how they will work with the trade union movement? Do they want to return to the conflicts of 1973, or do they now say – ‘We too will work the Social Contract.’ No-one knows. But how can a Tory Party even offer a Social Contract to the trade unions when it is pledged to the social policies and inequalities which strike at the, roots of our own movement? No. The Social Contract stands confirmed yesterday for the next three years because there is no other way, and it demands complete co-operation between the Party, the Government and the unions.

When I say there is no other way, that does not mean that it is going to be quick or easy. That has been promised before. It is neither. Britain has lived for too long on borrowed time, borrowed money, borrowed ideas. We live in too troubled a world to be able to promise that in a matter of months, or even in a couple of years, that we shall enter the promised land. The route is long and hard. But the long march has at last begun, and I hope to lead you at least some part of the way, with the Social Contract and our industrial strategy as our guide.

For too long, perhaps ever since the war, we postponed facing up to fundamental choices and fundamental changes in our society and in our economy. That is what I mean when I say we have been living on borrowed time. For too long this country - all of us, yes, this Conference too - has been ready to settle for borrowing money abroad to maintain our standards of life, instead of grappling with the fundamental problems of British industry. Governments of both parties have failed to ignite the fires of industrial growth in the ways that countries with very different political and economic philosophies have done. Take Germany; France, Japan - different countries, different philosophies. We are, as you know, still borrowing money. But this time we are not borrowing - if the Government con­tinues on its present course - to pay for yet another short-lived consumer boom of the kind which used to buy success at the polls - or so we were told - but which never bought success in the world’s markets or at the work place. We are borrowing now partly to pay for our huge investment in the North Sea. We are borrowing, too, because other industrial nations volunteer credits, so that our strategy and our proposals for regenerating British industry need not be thwarted by short-term speculative movements of sterling balances - a load we have still been unable to shed. We are determined that this borrowing will be used to act and to press on with the task of rebuilding a regenerated manufactur­ing industry. This time we are not going for a consumer boom on borrowed money: we are going to invest it in our future.

The cosy world we were told would go on for ever, where full employment would be guaran­teed by a stroke of the Chancellor’s pen, cutting taxes, deficit spending, that cosy world is gone. Yesterday delegates pointed to the first sorry fruits: a high rate of unemployment. The rate of unemployment today - there is no need for me to say this to you - cannot be justified on any grounds, least of all the human dignity of those involved. But Mr. Chairman and comrades, I did not become a member of our Party, still less did I become the Leader of our Party, to pro­pound shallow analyses and false remedies for fundamental economic and social problems.

When we reject unemployment as an economic instrument - as we do - and when we reject also superficial remedies, as socialists must, then we must ask ourselves unflinchingly what is the cause of high unemployment. Quite simply and unequivocally, it is caused by paying ourselves more than the value of what we produce. There are no scapegoats. This is as true in a mixed economy under a Labour Government as it is under capitalism or under communism. It is an absolute fact of life which no Government, be it left or right, can alter. Of course in Eastern Europe you cannot price yourself out of your job, because you cannot withdraw your labour. So those Governments can at least guarantee the appearance of full employment. But that is not the democratic way.

We used to think that you could spend your way out of a recession, and increase employ­ment by cutting taxes and boosting Government spending. I tell you in all candour that that option no longer exists, and that in so far as it ever did exist, it only worked on each occasion since the war by injecting a bigger dose of infla­tion into the economy, followed by a higher level of unemployment as the next step. Higher inflation followed by higher unemployment. We have just escaped from the highest rate of inflation this country has known; we have not yet escaped from the consequences: high unemployment.

That is the history of the last 20 years. Each time we did this the twin evils of unemployment and inflation have hit hardest those least able to stand them. Not those with the strongest bargaining power, no, it has not hit those. It has hit the poor, the old and the sick. We have strug­gled, as a Party, to try to maintain their stan­dards, and indeed to improve them, against the strength of the free collective bargaining power that we have seen exerted as some people have tried to maintain their standards against this economic policy.

Now we must get back to fundamentals. First, overcoming unemployment now unambiguously depends on our labour costs being at least com­parable with those of our major competitors. Second, we can only become competitive by having the right kind of investment at the right kind of level, and by significantly improving the productivity of both labour and capital. Third, we will fail - and I say this to those who have been pressing about public expenditure, to which I will come back - if we think we can buy our way out by printing what Denis Healey calls ‘confetti money’ to pay ourselves more than we produce. I do not care what economic system we live in - at least, I do care very much - but the moral I want to draw is this that whatever system we live under these fundamentals are at the heart of the standard of life of the people of the country concerned, and we ignore them at our peril. They are also at the heart of the Social Contract and of our industrial strategy.

Britain is now at a watershed. We have the chance to make real and fundamental choices about priorities which are absolutely necessary to achieve a growing and prosperous manufac­turing industry, with all the advantages and easements that can follow.

Let me be quite clear. If we did not possess the Social Contract and an industrial strategy that has been agreed between the Government and employers and trade unions, with all the socialist measures that are involved in that Contract and in the industrial strategy, if we did not possess this we would have no chance of forging a pow­erful British economy in the next decade. But we are getting co-operation on these issues.

The Manifesto was right when it said that the first priority of the Labour Government must be a determined attack on inflation. That remains; we have halved it in the last twelve months but we must do more yet. The Government’s objec­tive must be to reach inflation rates comparable with those of our major competitors by the end of next year. We are already getting there.

The regeneration of British industry has begun. The National Enterprise Board is in place and is in business. The Industry Act is working. The detailed examination of the 39 main sectors of British industry by employers and trade unions together has produced agreed reports on what is needed in each sector in the matter of new plant, new machinery, better use of existing plant, proper design, innovation, good marketing, after-sales services, increased training and skilled manpower to avoid bottle­necks. We know what needs to be done. Industry knows what needs to be done. Will both sides of industry now go through with it? If so, then we are at the beginning of a new era that will expand our so-far dwindling manufacturing base.

Let me add one more thing about how to get a strong manufacturing sector of industry. Hold on to your seats. The willingness of industry to invest in new plant and machinery requires, of course, that we overcome inflation, but also that industry is left with sufficient funds and has suf­ficient confidence to make the new investments. When I say they must have sufficient funds, I mean they must he able to earn a surplus and that is a euphemism for saying they must be able to make a profit. (Applause)

Whether you call it a surplus or a profit, it is necessary for a healthy industrial system, whether it operates in a socialist economy, a mixed economy or a capitalist economy. If industry cannot retain and generate sufficient funds as a result of its operations, and replace old plant and machinery, then you will whistle in vain for the investment and we shall continue to slide downhill. These are elementary facts of life. They are known to every trade unionist. Who would they sooner go and negotiate with when they want an increase in pay: a firm that is bankrupt or a firm that is doing well and generat­ing a good surplus?

The primary concern of our industrial strategy and our economic policy for the next three years is quite simple. The strategy and the priority is to create more wealth, and to do it with the agree­ment and the support of the trade union move­ment. Our social policy is concerned with the distribution of wealth. These two aspects of pol­icy should not be regarded as being in conflict, nor should we put them in conflict with each other. They must be harmonised. The wealth must be created before it is distributed. This is where I believe a misunderstanding, or perhaps something worse, has arisen between the Gov­ernment and the Party, on the question of public expenditure.

You know we have not been creating wealth as fast as we have been distributing it. Over the last three years you know that our domestic product has risen by 2 per cent and the increase in our public expenditure, including central and local government, has increased by 18 per cent. We have made shift to meet this, yes, by higher taxation at some points, borrowing from abroad and, worst of all, by printing money. Now we have to get back into balance again. Of course it cannot be done in twelve months. Our creditors understand this. Those with whom we discuss these matters in other countries understand this, because the disruption would be too great for the social system to bear. But it would be folly to continue to borrow at the present rate of £10 billion a year, even if we could find the lenders - and we are not always very polite to them. Whatever we do in the short term, the only long-term cure for unemployment is to create a healthy manufacturing industry that will hold its own overseas, and in doing so it will then certainly be able to retain its grip on the domestic market. It is by a healthy and expanding manu­facturing industry that we shall be able, in due course, to resume the growth and improvement of our social services and also create the jobs that are necessary if we are to reach what we all desperately require: our full employment targets.

Like everyone in the Labour Movement, I believe in a high level of public expenditure. But I part company with those who believe we can rely indefinitely on foreign borrowing to provide for greater social expenditure, a better welfare service, better hospitals, better education, the renewal of our inner cities and so on. In the end these things, comrades, are only provided by our own efforts.

Of course a Labour Government must not, and will not, stand by and do nothing about unemployment except wait for this agreed indus­trial strategy to succeed. As regards the matter of selective import controls, which was raised yesterday by a number of delegates, let me say that whether to introduce them or not has very little to do with socialist philosophy. It is a mat­ter of calculating where we get the biggest advantage. After all, I grew up in the days when import controls were the remedy of the Conservative Government. So it has nothing to do with socialism. It is a question of where we get the best advantage. Already various ways, of controlling imports exist in a number of fields. We shall continue to examine them case by case and I am already publicly committed to discuss the particular problem of Japanese imports with the European heads of State when we meet at The Hague in November. There will be a constant dialogue, I promise you, between the TUC and the CBI, the Government and the Party on this matter and action will be taken where it can be shown that it is to our net advantage. There is no philosophical block of any sort about that.

Mr. Chairman and comrades, in recent weeks, as some of you know, I have visited the North-East. I have been to Glasgow; I have been to Merseyside; I have been to the West Midlands. I have listened to some pretty straight talking about unemployment. I accept the criti­cism but I say in reply that there are no soft options, nor will a generation of decline in British industry be reversed by gimmicks. That is why, in asking for the Movement’s support for our present industrial strategy, I ask for more than your loyalty. That can be eroded. Indeed I can understand the circumstances in which it is. What the Government needs - what we all need - is your understanding and the conviction that will follow that understanding. Then let there be a determination to go out into the workshop, to go to the streets, to be on the doorsteps and to explain with passion to others why this is the only way for our Movement and for our country. We have a duty to fight for it. If we follow it in the end we shall save not only our Party, not only our Government. We shall save our coun­try.

Mr. Chairman, while our policy is working through, we have embarked on a succession of schemes aimed at alleviating unemployment wherever and whenever we can do so within the context of the overall strategy. In particular I emphasise, as Albert Booth and other delegates did yesterday, the need to try to alleviate the problem of youth unemployment. Unemploy­ment at any age is unacceptable but for a school-leaver it is especially demoralising, and those who leave at the minimum age of 16 need special help. Talking to educators, as I have done, and to employers who take on the school leavers, it has been put to me very strongly by both that there is still a real lack of contact between them. The machinery exists to provide this; it should be used in a more urgent and positive way. Two-way communication between schools’ careers advisers and employers must be a con­tinuous process, with full co-operation on both sides. The importance of hard thinking about this difficult transition that our young people make from the world of school to the world of work cannot be exaggerated. Much has been done and is now being done through the work experience programme and the great increase in the number of places provided for vocational training. There was a shaft of light last week with the fall in the number of unemployed young peo­ple. We expect this trend to continue. In addi­tion, the Job Creation Programme, the Tempor­ary Employment Subsidy, the remarkable increase in places for training, the Work Experi­ence Programme which came into force on Sep­tember 21, the Youth Employment Subsidy which comes into operation on October 1 are all helping to alleviate a serious problem. Then last Thursday Albert Booth announced the job release scheme in assisted areas, to begin on January 1 next, which will open up new em­ployment opportunities for younger unemployed people seeking work. There is to be a tax-free allowance of £23 per week to full-time men and women in assisted areas who retire and who are within a year of their respective minimum pen­sionable ages.

We shall continue with these efforts. We shall continue to seek out, with the co-operation of the unions and others, effective means of trying to reduce unemployment by selective action, taking special account of the position of young people. The wide variety of selective measures which we have now brought in will help about half a million of those without jobs in this period of exceptionally high unemployment. Travelling around the country, I have been much encour­aged to hear from teachers, from social workers, from the young people themselves and from employers that they value these measures as a very real contribution to the alleviation of this problem. But I repeat that none of these meas­ures, however worthwhile, are a substitute for a thriving economy generating full employment.

We are, we always have been, we remain a Party of social reform, and far more needs to be done to prepare young people for the time when they leave school. There should be much closer co-operation between employers and schools, and employers could do more to make their requirements known to teachers. Heads of schools could extend their sphere of interest to obtaining and acting upon the advice of local firms about their requirements. Firms could provide practical help of various kinds to local schools, and so discover how they could make better use of the actual and potential skills of school leavers. Personnel officers in industry could ask teachers to appraise their training techniques in industry. Co-operation in these ways would help industrial and commercial training to flow naturally from the last years at school. Some schools, perhaps many, need to give their careers departments more serious attention than they have done.

I am concerned at the gap that exists at many levels between education and industry today, not only at this level but at other levels too. Let us begin by helping our young people to fit themselves for life in their work, as well as in their leisure. Let us also, may I say in passing, take note and take account of the anxiety amongst parents at some aspects of the education of their children. I have been in a number of schools which have impressed me deeply by their inno­vation and their experiment. There are new ways of learning that were unknown to us, vou­ched for by the teachers. This is good. But let me emphasise that the greatest gifts a teacher can give to a child are the basic tools of learning and a desire for knowledge. A literate and numerate child has the key to open the door of learning and the key to the freedom of the mind.

Let me turn to another aspect of our modern society: freedom. Democratic socialists em­phasise that a fundamental aspect of freedom is the freedom of minorities within our society. Freedom from discrimination. There can be no equivocation, and there is none in the Labour Movement, on racial matters. We must oppose all forms of racial discrimination in this country and fight the messages of hatred which are designed to divide people from each other. (Applause) The Party has taken up the chal­lenge. We shall fight, we shall continue in the way in which we have begun on this matter. Once he or she has been accepted for settlement in our country every newcomer has the same rights and obligations as everyone else. We wish them to make as real a contribution to the coun­try as other immigrants have done throughout our long history, and the new Race Relations Bill currently before Parliament aims to help them do that. As to the numbers who come here, I have never wavered from the view that in a small and highly-populated country there is a limit to the number of immigrants we can absorb. Therefore strict control over immigration is necessary, subject to honouring our commit­ments, and Britain will do that.

Next, a word about devolution, an important constitutional development which we will dis­cuss later this morning and to which Michael Foot will reply. Will you allow me to say how deeply I appreciate the support of Michael who, in the interests of the unity of our Movement and our Party, has put aside his personal feelings in order to help our Party and the Government. The debate on devolution will go on - it is going on now - but it cannot continue indefinitely without being brought to a conclusion. There­fore we shall ask Parliament next Session to enact the necessary legislation so that our pro­posals will be on the Statute Book in the course of 1977. Parliament has plenty of time to debate the Bill, but Parliament owes it to the people of Scotland and Wales to reach a definite and a favourable conclusion on the matter. (Applause) At the end of the process Parliament must be able to offer the people of Scotland, and of Wales, a real and substantial measure of control over their own affairs within the overall framework of the United Kingdom. What we will not create is a half-way house to separation, to which the vast majority of the people in these islands are totally and completely opposed. (Applause)

I have been around a long time, some of you will think too long. My political instinct tells me that the successful implementation of devolution offers us, as a whole, the best way of keeping the United Kingdom united, while at the same time enhancing the vigour of national diversity within these islands. I know that these proposals have raised questions in the minds of our local author­ity members in the English regions. Yes, we shall look at those with some care. I know some of them arise because of the disillusionment with the expensive and bureaucratic local govern­ment structure foisted on us by the last Tory administration. (Applause)

As to the continuing tragedy of Northern Ire­land, I am sure that the whole Conference would like me to express our heartfelt thanks and admi­ration to Merlyn Rees for the way he has carried out his responsibilities during 2½ years. (Applause) Roy Mason has now inherited this awesome task. He will carry to the hard-pressed people of Northern Ireland the same message: that the Government will use its best endeavours to put an end to the violence and to achieve a political solution there. Let me repeat - because some things have to be said time after time after time - that there will be no economic and no political withdrawal. The situation has been improved by stopping the use of detention in Northern Ireland. What is now needed is a rigorous determination by everyone that the rule of law shall prevail there and that no one shall be exempt. In that the Government needs the full co-operation of all the people themselves. This has recently been illustrated by the spontaneous Women’s Peace Movement, which I welcome. (Applause) Let us not forget in this forum another group which has maintained a consistent non-sectarian stand throughout all these difficult years. I refer to the Northern Ireland trade unions. (Applause) We make clear once again to the men of violence that we are not to be intimi­dated into abandoning our duty to all the people of the Province.

Without pre-empting our debate next Thurs­day, I should like to mention briefly some recent developments in Southern Africa. The announcement on Friday evening by Mr. Smith of his acceptance of the principle of majority rule within the two-year time scale that I laid down on March 22 last, could be an historic turning point in the future of the sub-continent. For Bri­tain a solution in Rhodesia on the basis of major­ity rule is a debt of honour. For Africa, without it, there is a constant threat to peace and to stability. I should like to put on record my thanks to Secretary Kissinger for his charac­teristic and remarkable contribution to recent developments. (Applause) Without the decisive intervention of the United States there would not have been this turnabout in the attitude of Mr. Smith.

In the last few days I have been in contact with the four African Presidents who have them­selves made a remarkable contribution to the search for a peaceful settlement: Their response to Mr. Smith’s broadcast last Friday has been a tough one. That is not surprising, considering the history and considering the suspicion that arises from the history. But the prize within our grasp is an interim government with a black majority and majority rule within two years. That must be preferable to an increasingly viol­ent armed struggle in which thousands of inno­cent men and women on both sides would lose their lives. The Labour Government wants to see an interim government set up rapidly, say within four to six weeks. We will play a full and active part in promoting such an end. The meet­ing to negotiate the interim government need not necessarily be held in Salisbury or elsewhere in Rhodesia. The Foreign Secretary, Tony Cros­land, is prepared to back the convening of negotiations in any place convenient to the par­ties concerned. But the essential ingredient is the rapid establishment of the interim govern­ment. Once that has happened there will be no going back. The die will then be cast. There will be difficulties in the months ahead, but if the forthcoming negotiations can be brought to a successful conclusion, then Britain will at long last have discharged her last colonial responsibil­ity in Africa with honour.

The borders of our Movement’s concern have never been drawn at Dover. When the Govern­ment is attacked about cuts in public expendi­ture at a time of great economic difficulty, let me remind Conference of what has not so far been mentioned; that the Government left untouched our aid programme to the poorer countries. We have in no way withdrawn from any of our responsibilities to them. (Applause) We still take upon ourselves the task of assisting those who are burdened, the two-thirds of mankind who are burdened by poverty, ignorance and disease.

I regret that some of the momentum of the dialogue that was opened up by Harold Wilson at the Commonwealth Prime Ministers’ Confer­ence has been lost for the time being. I believe this will not persist. We will do all in our power to ensure that the response of the industrialised world in the north/south dialogue is a construc­tive one.

We shall also use our influence to promote a more constructive dialogue in East/West rela­tions, in the search for increased international security. Incidentally, we should not assume that we are alone in our troubles. Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union have their economic problems too. We wish to see an expansion of economic activity in East/West trade. I do not accept the arguments of those who say that such a growth will serve only to assist the expansion of Soviet armed strength. There is no doubt that the Soviet Union has built substantial armed forces but nevertheless our analysis is, and this is accepted by a great many people outside this country, that the develop­ment of economic relations can increasingly involve the Soviet Union in a more stable and beneficial relationship with the West which it will not be in their interest to disturb. This is the policy of detente, and as signatories to the Hel­sinki agreement we regard it as essential that its implications should be accepted in all the fields of economic relations, cultural exchanges and human relations as well. We have in common with the Soviet Union the desire to avoid the horrors of war. We proceed on the assumption that the Soviet Union is in earnest in its wish to improve relations between states - I emphasise the word ‘states’ - even though, as their own statements have told us, the ideological struggle will continue between parties. Let there be no doubt about their intentions on that.

Finally, let me turn to our domestic Party affairs. In the media I am often dubbed a Party man. Indeed, it seems that to be loyal to your party is the worst possible thing the media can say about you. I accept the description as an accolade. I am only too well aware that the strength of this Government rests on the Party. Without the Party none of us would hold the office we do. That is why I want the closest possible relationship between Party and Gov­ernment. But it must be based on a mutual respect and a recognition of each other’s respon­sibilities.

To tell the truth, I believe the relationship which has grown up between the TUC and the Government in the past two and a half years has developed faster than the relationship between the Government and the National Executive Committee. (Applause) This should not be so. It is not of my seeking. Every member of the Cabinet, every member of the Government knows that he shares the responsibility to estab­lish close relations with the National Executive Committee and its study groups, as well as with the Parliamentary Party itself. I do not want to retreat behind the stock defence that ‘the Gov­ernment must govern,’ if that becomes a polite way of telling the Party to go to hell. But the NEC must remember, too, that they are respon­sible. Yes, they are responsible for their statements and their resolutions. But the Govern­ment is accountable for its actions and that is the difference between us. (Applause) We are accountable in a parliamentary democracy to Parliament. Parliamentary candidates who offer themselves to the electorate on the basis that they are willing to suspend their judgment in favour of extra-parliamentary bodies, whoever they may be, will receive short shrift from the electorate. Of course Members of Parliament must be sensitive to the views of their general management committees. I tell you that they are. I know that, from what they say to me about the attitudes of their own GMCs. There is a two-way traffic between the two. Of course they are influenced. But Parliament has to take deci­sions by their votes; that is where they are responsible.

There are many aspects of our Party demo­cracy that could be looked at with advantage. Is the Party really satisfied with a youth movement which has only half the branches it had ten years ago, and which is increasingly dominated by a single brand of socialist sectarianism? (Applause)

Could not the National Executive Committee itself reflect the Party better, if it included local government representatives and perhaps rep­resentatives of the regional councils?(Applause) I also draw the Party’s attention to a new factor creeping into the Party, which I warn against - namely those elements who misuse the word ‘socialist’ and who seek to infiltrate our party and use it for their own ends. (Applause) They are almost always recognisable by their jargon and by their intolerance. They are as much the enemy of the Tribune Group as they are of the Manifesto Group, or even of the great majority of us who do not happen to belong to either but are simply ordinary members of the Party. The main bulwark against this infiltration is a strong and active membership in every constituency, for these people represent only a small group. But I do suggest to the National Executive Committee that they could do well to examine these activities, see what is going on and report back to the Party.

I raise these matters, not because I am on a witch-hunt but because I want the Government and the Party to work closely together. To do that the Party must be strong and representative.

Much good work has already been done. I very much welcome ‘Labour’s Programme 1976.’ It has involved the work of hundreds of volunteers, as well as members of the NEC and our hard-working staff at Transport House. I am sure that neither they, nor you, will expect the Government, dealing as we have to with the day-to-day realities of the situation to simply swallow whole and undigested the 147 pages of ‘Labour’s Programme 1976.’ A dialogue will be necessary and it will not just be carried on by monthly resolutions, or a steady stream of press releases from the National Executive Sub-Committees. To be successful it will require mutual respect, mutual trust, a recognition of our differing roles and our separate respon­sibilities. That is my desire and it is in that spirit that I invite the National Executive to join us in planning ahead. If we can approach it in this way the Government will be more sensitive to the Party's wishes and the Party’s deliberations will have a sharper cutting edge from being more closely involved in the realities of decision-making.

We began as a Party of protest. We must never lose that, never forget it. There are many ills and many evils in the condition of our society that have still to be remedied. But we are more; we are now a Party of Government, a Party which has put many of the aspirations of the pioneers on the statute book, as the law of our land.

I conclude my Report. Inevitably it has dealt with many varied issues and problems, some of them I regret to say in not as detailed a way as I should have liked. But Derek Gladwin said to me last night ‘Keep it as short as you can.’ What I would like to emerge from it is that the Government is willing to tell the people the truth, willing to consult with the Party, willing to work with the trade unions and with the people to solve our national problems. That is the philosophy of the Social Contract. Do not listen to the faint-hearted. Have confidence. The Labour Movement has the responsibility. Now let it prove that it has the maturity to lead our country and our Party to a new future. (Applause)"

-- First, the unanimous statement that thanks to the policies agreed upon in Rambouillet, we have emerged in many respects from world recession.
-- Second, the unanimity of our political will to combat inflation decisively during a period of economic upturn as well.
-- Third, our commo:u determination to promote our economies in order to create new employment opportunities and thereby decrease still existing unemployment and to achieve full employment again.
-- Fourth, that in order to achieve this goal we need a social consensus in our countries.
We can state with satisfaction that from our first meeting in Rambouillet emerged a broad flow of confidence in the positive development of the world economy. Today we can say without exaggeration that this confidence was justified. I expect that from Puerto Rico will emerge additional and widened confidence in the positive development of the world economy in additional fields also. 1 want to state tnat· this meeting in Puerto Rico has again shown that the word of the solidarity of the Western World is no empty formula but that we are in fact in a position to satisfy our expectations. We did not make any internationally binding decisions. These are matters for our national cabinets or parliaments or international organizations of which we are members or of international conferences to which we belong, particularly the European Community. But I may say for my government and for my colleagues Centscher and Appel that we are grateful for the suggestions we received here which we shall attempt to realize in the institutions and organizations to which we belong."

The TEMPORARY PRESIDENT: Eleven years have elapsed since I made my first acquaintance with the General ksembly of the United Nations in 1966 as a representative. It was approximately two months ago that I assumed my duties as Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Sri Lanka. 6. In the economic sphere the most strenuous and diligent efforts have been exerted in the search for solutions to the problems of development and international economic cooperation through the implementation of the decisions adopted by the General Assembly at its seventh special session. 4. Twenty-two years have elapsad since the Bandung principles were declarecl, While these principles have all the appearance of counsels of perfection in an extremely imperfect world, there is not one of ther.1 that has lost a fragment of its relevance dUring the 22 years that have elapsed since they were enunciated.
5. The last 12 months have witnessed feverish diplomatic activity in areas of intense political turbulence. There have been many developments which raised hopes of progress only to have those hopes dampened by equivocation or indecision, or imperilled if not destroyed by extremism.
6. In the economic sphere the most strenuous and diligent efforts have been exerted in the search for solutions to the problems of development and international economic cooperation through the implementation of the decisions adopted by the General Assembly at its seventh special session.
7. The thirty-first session was suspended on 22 December 1976 to enable the Paris Conference on International Economic Co-operation to conclude its ministerial meeting and to report its results to the General Assembly at a resumed session, which began last week. The resu'lts of the Paris Conference and of the resumed session can best be assessed as having been of limited efficacy. The agreement to establish a common fund was, however, itself a welcome accomplishment. But the purpose, objectives and other essential features of the fund present a vast range of problems to be settled through UNCTAD before the fund can come into operation. The fund itself is only one element of the new international economic order, whose main purpose is to ensure a more equitable and just distribution of the world's resources, a more rational utilization of these resources and such changes in the structure of international trade 4:S would progressively improve the living conditions of the overwhelming mdjority of mankind. The expectations kindled by such instruments as the Declaration and the Programme of Action on the EstabEshment of a New International Economic Order [resolutions 3201 (S- VI) and 3702 (S- VI)I and the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States [resolution J281 (XXIX)j ~tiIl remain only a distant vision. A more determined and consci(mtious effort is required if we are to maintain the unity of the human family and avert the strife and bitterness that must inevitably result from the present conditions of economic disorder and inequality. This session of the General Assembly will need to take a clear step in the direction pointed out by the two instruments that I have cited.
8. The arms race has become a frantic stampede. The degree of sophistication and refinement of weaponry has assumed astronomical dimensions with the possible inclusion of the cruise missile, the backfire and the neutron bomb in the arsenals of the super-Powers.
9. We would all hope that the special session on disarmament will reverse the· present trend and set us firmly on the road towards the ultimate goal of general and complete disarmament, but in the meantime the first and most decisive step that could serve as a dramatic contribution to the special session would be the attainment of agreement on the conclusion of a comprehensive test-ban treaty. 
10. While dealing with the economic sphere, we must take special note of the stage that has been reached in the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea. At the sixth session of that Conference, which ended on 15 July this year, the Conference succeeded in merging the various negotiating texts into an informal composite negotiating text. l Dissatisfaction with some of the provisions of the text, especiclly those relating to the exploration and exploitation of the mineral resources of the international sea-bed area, and with the forms of procedure adopted, has been expressed. I am confident that statesmanship will overcome these difficulties and that the conference will before long provide the world with a new law for the oceans which will be generaHy acceptable and will give substance to the concept of the common ht..ritage of mankind as well as providing a powerful impetus to the establishment of the new international economic order.
11. An organization whose paramount objective is the maintenance of international peace and security must view with profound anxiety and dismay the developments in southern Africa and the Middle East. The assaults on human dignity and on the human rights of the black peoples of southern Africa by the racist and repressive white minority regimes in that area have been growing in recent months, gradually diminishing hopes for a peaceful settlement, undermining the efforts of those countries which have been negotiating with both parties to secure a change in the policies of the white minority regimes and to create the conditions for the transition to majority rule.
12. The same evaluation could be applied with equal force to the situation in the Middle East. The State of Israel owes its existence to the United Nations. There i~ no other jUridical basis for its establishment apart from the partition resolution adopted at the second session of the General Assembly [resolution 181 (lIJI. That resolution provided for the establishment of independent Arab and Jewish States and for a special international regime for the City of Jerusalem. The legitimate rights of the Arab people of Palestine cannot be cloaked in any other terms. The State of Israel has continued to consolidate its occupation of territory seized in war in violation of a fundamental principle of international law - the inadmissibility of acquisition of territory by force. The Government of Israel has also sought to consolidate its occupation by the establishment of Jewish settlements in the occupied territories and thereby shown a total disregard for the 1949 Geneva Conventions.
13. While on the one hand the State 9f Israel is allowed to act in defiance of international law and in a manner which reveals clearly its refusal to recognize the rights of the Palestinians, conditions are imposed on the Palestinians for their representation by the Palestine Liberation Organization-which is recognized by the overwhelming majority of the United Nations membership as the legitimate custodian of the rights of the Palestinian Arabs-at the talks aimed at the attainment of a just and honourable solution.
14. In the interest of brevity I have referred only to some of the most serious developments in the preceding 12 months which will be considered under various items of the agenda of this session. I do not want to strike a pessimistic note. However, when we look around we cannot fail to be distressed by the depressing reality of a deteriorating world situation. Problems of peace, security and the welfare of mankind are fundamental. They are still with us, calling for solution. But what is the response of the world community? Distinguished representatives, the answer rests with you. I wish every one of you success in your deliberations and in the search for solutions in the session which is about to commence under the able guidance of the new President.

10182,"Jimmy Carter, Presidential Inauguration Speech",https://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/carter.asp,Jimmy Carter,President (United States),Inauguration Speech,1977,,"For myself and for our Nation, I want to thank my predecessor for all he has done to heal our land.

In this outward and physical ceremony we attest once again to the inner and spiritual strength of our Nation. As my high school teacher, Miss Julia Coleman, used to say: ""We must adjust to changing times and still hold to unchanging principles.""

Here before me is the Bible used in the inauguration of our first President, in 1789, and I have just taken the oath of office on the Bible my mother gave me a few years ago, opened to a timeless admonition from the ancient prophet Micah:

""He hath showed thee, O man, what is good; and what doth the Lord require of thee, but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God."" (Micah 6: 8)

This inauguration ceremony marks a new beginning, a new dedication within our Government, and a new spirit among us all. A President may sense and proclaim that new spirit, but only a people can provide it.

Two centuries ago our Nation's birth was a milestone in the long quest for freedom, but the bold and brilliant dream which excited the founders of this Nation still awaits its consummation. I have no new dream to set forth today, but rather urge a fresh faith in the old dream.

Ours was the first society openly to define itself in terms of both spirituality and of human liberty. It is that unique self- definition which has given us an exceptional appeal, but it also imposes on us a special obligation, to take on those moral duties which, when assumed, seem invariably to be in our own best interests.

You have given me a great responsibility--to stay close to you, to be worthy of you, and to exemplify what you are. Let us create together a new national spirit of unity and trust. Your strength can compensate for my weakness, and your wisdom can help to minimize my mistakes.

Let us learn together and laugh together and work together and pray together, confident that in the end we will triumph together in the right.

The American dream endures. We must once again have full faith in our country--and in one another. I believe America can be better. We can be even stronger than before.

Let our recent mistakes bring a resurgent commitment to the basic principles of our Nation, for we know that if we despise our own government we have no future. We recall in special times when we have stood briefly, but magnificently, united. In those times no prize was beyond our grasp.

But we cannot dwell upon remembered glory. We cannot afford to drift. We reject the prospect of failure or mediocrity or an inferior quality of life for any person. Our Government must at the same time be both competent and compassionate.

We have already found a high degree of personal liberty, and we are now struggling to enhance equality of opportunity. Our commitment to human rights must be absolute, our laws fair, our natural beauty preserved; the powerful must not persecute the weak, and human dignity must be enhanced.

We have learned that ""more"" is not necessarily ""better,"" that even our great Nation has its recognized limits, and that we can neither answer all questions nor solve all problems. We cannot afford to do everything, nor can we afford to lack boldness as we meet the future. So, together, in a spirit of individual sacrifice for the common good, we must simply do our best.

Our Nation can be strong abroad only if it is strong at home. And we know that the best way to enhance freedom in other lands is to demonstrate here that our democratic system is worthy of emulation.

To be true to ourselves, we must be true to others. We will not behave in foreign places so as to violate our rules and standards here at home, for we know that the trust which our Nation earns is essential to our strength.

The world itself is now dominated by a new spirit. Peoples more numerous and more politically aware are craving and now demanding their place in the sun--not just for the benefit of their own physical condition, but for basic human rights.

The passion for freedom is on the rise. Tapping this new spirit, there can be no nobler nor more ambitious task for America to undertake on this day of a new beginning than to help shape a just and peaceful world that is truly humane.

We are a strong nation, and we will maintain strength so sufficient that it need not be proven in combat--a quiet strength based not merely on the size of an arsenal, but on the nobility of ideas.

We will be ever vigilant and never vulnerable, and we will fight our wars against poverty, ignorance, and injustice--for those are the enemies against which our forces can be honorably marshaled.

We are a purely idealistic Nation, but let no one confuse our idealism with weakness.

Because we are free we can never be indifferent to the fate of freedom elsewhere. Our moral sense dictates a clearcut preference for these societies which share with us an abiding respect for individual human rights. We do not seek to intimidate, but it is clear that a world which others can dominate with impunity would be inhospitable to decency and a threat to the well-being of all people.

The world is still engaged in a massive armaments race designed to ensure continuing equivalent strength among potential adversaries. We pledge perseverance and wisdom in our efforts to limit the world's armaments to those necessary for each nation's own domestic safety. And we will move this year a step toward ultimate goal--the elimination of all nuclear weapons from this Earth. We urge all other people to join us, for success can mean life instead of death.

Within us, the people of the United States, there is evident a serious and purposeful rekindling of confidence. And I join in the hope that when my time as your President has ended, people might say this about our Nation:

- that we had remembered the words of Micah and renewed our search for humility, mercy, and justice;

- that we had torn down the barriers that separated those of different race and region and religion, and where there had been mistrust, built unity, with a respect for diversity;

- that we had found productive work for those able to perform it;

- that we had strengthened the American family, which is the basis of our society;

- that we had ensured respect for the law, and equal treatment under the law, for the weak and the powerful, for the rich and the poor;

- and that we had enabled our people to be proud of their own Government once again.

I would hope that the nations of the world might say that we had built a lasting peace, built not on weapons of war but on international policies which reflect our own most precious values.

These are not just my goals, and they will not be my accomplishments, but the affirmation of our Nation's continuing moral strength and our belief in an undiminished, ever-expanding American dream."
10186,"Lazar Mojsov, PGA Inauguration Speech",http://undocs.org/en/A/33/PV.1,Lazar Mojsov,President of the General Assembly,Inauguration Speech,1977,,"3. The TEMPORARY PRESIDENT: The tradition established in the United Nations makes it incumbent upon me, at the beginning of the thirty-third regular session of the General Assembly, to refer briefly to the chaIJenges which our world Organization will be facing during the next 90· days of deliberations of its General Assembly in the present complex international situation inherited from the past year. 4. Although I have already had the opportunity-owing to a concurrence of circul11stances- to address this distin· guished gathering, the General Assembly, on several occa· sions this year, I hope I shall not abuse your patience unduly by tracing a brief outline of the road we have traversed and the experience we have gained in the period from last September to the present day. 5. The year under review was marked by exceptional activity on the part of the General Assembly, almost unprecedented in the history of the United Nations. This called for extraordinary efforts on the part of all dele· gations, as well as of the Secretary-General and his associates. 6. At its thirty-second session, the General Assembly had a record number of items on its agenda: a total of 131; it held the largest number of meetings and adopted an impressive number of resolutions and decisions. 7. In the course of this year we held three special sessions of the General Assembly, responding thus to the necessities of the present·day world situation and to the demands of Member States that some international issues of paramount importance be discussed in the Assembly in an urgent and special manner. 8. The eighth special session of the General Assembly was of particular importance, in spite of its short duration. It established a pattern for the setting up and financing of United Nations peace·keeping forces when the Security Council, on the basis of the Charter, undertakes urgent operations aimed at safeguarding peace and security in the world. It is known that, in the past, there have been serious crises in the work of the General Assembly, owing to the fact that the system of responsibility for and the financing of peace-keeping forces had not been elaborated suffi· ciently. At present, as a result of the decisions taken at the eighth special session, a new practice has been esta blished which will prevent the repetition of past mistakes. 9. The ninth special session, devoted to Namibia, raised in an urgent manner the question of the final elimination of obstructions hindering the process of the achievement of independence by Namibia, and that of the definitive assumptioll by the United Nations of a decisive role and influence in respect of this problem which has been facing us for a number of years. The ninth special session not only dramatized the whole situation regarding Namibia but contributed decisively to the break·through which is at present emerging along the path leading to the final liberation of Namibia and its accession to independence.
10. The tenth special session, devoted to disarmament, was of vital and historic importance for the further role to be played by the United Nations with respect to this most complex problem in contemporary international relations. In the course of five weeks of work and with the participa tion of an impressive number cf prominc nt stn tesmen from all over the world, the General Asscmbly assessed as untenable the present situation as regards the arms race, which threatens to have unpredictable negative conse· quences for international relations as a whole unless it is brought to an end as soon as possible. In its Final Document [resolution S-l 0/2/, the General Assembly at its tenth special session laid down the basic principles for further action by the United Nations aimed at curbing the arms race and undertaking effective measures towards disarmament. Of particular importance is the machinery for the continuous review of this complex problem in the United Nations and for the holding of further negotiations. Although the decisions taken by the Assembly at its tenth special session were not aimed at the adoption of concrete measures and the reaching of new international agreements and treaties on disarmament, they charted a long-term course of action by the internathl!ull community in this area and, even more important, proVided for special forums and organs for reviewing and conducting negutiations on all Rspects of the very complex problem of disarmament.
11. This very day, before the opening of this meeting, the consultations among Member States pr.)vidcd fur in para· graph J20 of the Final Document 01 the tenth special session of the General Assembly have been successfully completed. In a let ter just addressed to the SecretaryGeneral I have informed him of the composition of the Committee on Disarmament, which is open to the nuclear· weapon States and 35 other States. I Thus conditions have now been created for the early convening of the Committee on Disarmament and for the beginning of its work. 12. In addition to the activity of the General Assembly outlined earlier, two United Nations Conferences were held recently-one on comba ting racism and racial discrimi· nation,2 and the other on techn ical co·operation among developing countries. 3 The resumed seventh session of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law (If the Sea has also just been concluded. 13. Other organs of the General Assembly and of the United Nations, in particular the Security Council and the Economic and Social Council, have maintained a very dynamic pace in their activities and have adopted decisions of special importance. 14. Now we are again faced with a very extensive agenda for the thirty·third session, reflecting the major problems of pre~ent.day international relations. The months ahead will aga1l1 be marked by very intensive activity by the General Assembly 15. There is no doubt that these facts about the activities and the almost continuous involvement of the General Assembly and some other organs of the United Nations testify to the major role of our world Organization and to the trend towards once again sei71ng the Assembly of those important problems in the field of international relations which were being dealt with outside it. This is an indication of the increased confidence on the part of Member States and of world public opinion in the capacities of the General Assembly, despite occasional criticism addressed to it because of insufftcien t effectiveness in coming to grips with the most complex problems facing the world community. That is, without doubt, avery positive development. 16. However, learning from the experience gained, particularly in the course of this year when the activities of the General Assembly reached such intensity, we should also seriously consider the question how best to adapt the work and over·all activities of the Assembly and those of the United Nations as a whole to the ever-greater needs, which are not merely of a quantitative nature. The increasing number of States Members of the United Nations-and newly independen t countries will be joining us soon, thus enhancing the universal character of this unique world Organization-- as well as the constantly growing number of both old and new items 011 the agenda of the General Assembly, underline the need not only for such an adjustment but also for rationalization of the work and proper utilization of the time of the Assembly so that it may be adequate for appropriate deliberations and serious decision-making in respect of the complex problems included in the agenda of particular sessions.
17. The need has arisen for the General Assembly to examine its own internal structure, its distribution of work und its growing responsibilities. And thus, since extensive reconstruction work and adaptations will soon be under· taken in this plenary hall so that the General Assembly may meet the technical requirements of the Assembly as it is today, which differs a great deal from that of 1945 or 1955, it Willlllso be necessary to make new efforts aimed at a genuine reorganization of the method of work of the General Assembly. J am confident that this task also will be carried out successfully. The vitality of the Assembly has already been demonstrated in the course of its many years of active work when it had to face all the changes and new problems in the development of international relations and all the consequences of those changes, Which ineVitably affected its composition and the achievement of univer· sality as well as its over·all work and resu1ts. 18. Concurrently with such intensiw activity by the General Assembly, the world situation has also been evolving dynamically. In the year under review further deterioration and convulsions in some vital areas of international relations came to the fore. At the same time, however, neW negotiating processes have been initiated in almost all fields. The fact that these negotiations, particu. larly on some of the most complex and serious situations involving conllicts in the world, have not yet yielded decisive and positive results leading to the finding of lasting solutions based on just foundations, in the spirit of the principles of the United Nations and its relevant decisions, only proves the complexity of those situations and the existence of major clashes between certain international factors in various areas of conflict. There has been no escalation of armed conflict on a broader scale, although the negotiations and efforts to establish a dialogue for the settlement of crises were accompanied by setbacks and by pressures and aggressive acts and moves on the part of forces which have been persistently opposing the peaceful and just settlement of the problems that have been weighing heavily on the entire international comm1ll1ity for many years and on which the attention of the United Nations has constantly been focused. 19. However, it has become quite certain now that it is no longer possible to hold back and still less to arrest or render even more complicated the liberation processes in southern Africa. The peoples of Namibia and Zimbabwe have reached the decisive stage in their struggle for the termination of colonialism and the regime of racial discrimination and apartheid. It is necessary to intensify efforts within the United Nations and on the part of the whole international community in order to thwart the last manipulations and remove the remaining barriers on the road to the achievement of independence by those countries. I am confident tha t we shall soon greet in our midst in the General Assembly representatives of the peoples of Namibia and Zimbabwe as independent and free nations within the ranks of the States Members of the United Nations. 20. In other areas of decolonization, too, the anachronistic forms of domination and exploitation are inexorably nearing their end. The United Nations has made a great contribution to thc achievement of freedom and independence in vast regions where colonialism prevailed until not so long ago. The thirty-third session, too, will be bound to continue to monitor the development of the remaining colonial situations so that the dark age of colonialism may finally come to an end. 21. In the Middle East, efforts are being made to overcome the unfavourable development caused by the already well-known aggressive behaviour and annexationist aspirations of Israel in respect of its Arab neighbours. Here also it is becoming ever more obvious that it is impossible to ignore and constantly put forward new pre.conditions in respect of the rightful demands of the Arab countriessupported by the overwhelming majority in the United Nations and by the whole international community-for the liberation of all the Arab territories occupied in 1967 and for respect for the inalienable and legitimate right of the Palestinian people to self-determination and for their right to establish their own State. It is not possible to achieve a just and lasting peace in the Middle East without the participation of all the parties concerned, including the Palestine Liberation Organization, in the negotiating process. If these basic demands continue to be ignored we shall be faced with a new and dangerous development in the Middle East crisis, which for three decades now has done so much harm not only to all the peoples of that region, but also to the positive evolution of international relations in general. During this session the General Assembly will once again be confronted with all the aspects of the Middle East crisis. The United Nations cannot and must not remain aloof from active efforts to find at least a just and durable solution in the Middle East. 22. Othe; international disputes and conflicts have also reached the phase when initiatives are being taken for their definitive solution. It is necessary to intensify efforts for negotiations in the spirit of the relevant recommendations of the General Assembly and the stands taken by it. 23. The negotiations which, after the sixth and seventh special sessions of the General Assembly, began on a number of major problems and difficulties in the area of international economic relations have, unfortunately, come to a standstill. The expectation of the developing countries that the international community, and the highly developed c01ll1tries in particular, would address themselves with due attention and earnestness to the consideration of the problem of development in the world and the establishment of a new system of more eqUitable international economic relations has not been fulfilled. The General Assembly will soon be entrusted with the task of preparing for the new special session, in 1980, which will be devoted to international economic relations. Those preparations should serve, as is urgently demanded by all developing countries, to give a new impetus to the initiation of negotiations between the developing and the developed countries with a view to finding lasting and more meaningful solutions to the accumulated problems of development and ensuring the harmonious development of international economic rela· tions, in order to spare the international community new and even more serious disturbances and difficulties in the years ahead. 24. These are only some of the most important problems included in the comprehensive agenda now before the General Assembly. A year of very intensive and constant activity by tIle Assembly, a year of negotiations, however indecisive and hesitant they may be, is continuing. In the next few moments the General Assembly will elect its new President, who, together with all representatives, will endeavour to make a valuable personal contribution to the successful consideration of all the problems confronting the Assembly. Confident that the work of the thirty.third session of the Assembly will evolve in a constructive atmosphere, marked by genuine efforts to find appropriate solutions to all the problems it will discuss, I wish you utI much success in the fulfilment of this major task.

The prestige of the United Nations as the natural forum for discussing the problems ofmankind is greater than ever before. The Organization has acquired a universal character with the entry as Members of numerous States representing various forms of political and economic organization, and this has given the United Nations the pluralistic complexion which its founders intended it to have. This diverse assembly ofjuridically equal States, each with its own voice which no one can silence, is what makes the United Nations the appropriate setting for identifying conflicts. instead of Ignoring them, and for finding peaceful solutions to the disputes, great or small, which arise from conflicting interests. Experience has shown that it is difficult to negotiate outside the United Nations, even when it is believed, in good faith, that problems brought here because they affect world peace can become merely bilateral disputes. In reality, today there is hardly a dispute in the world that is bilateral. The conflicts that in our day threaten peace are not mere border incidents but problems which affect everyone, either because they occur in strategic regions or because they involve philosophical and legal principles which arouse the emotions of the world's peoples. It is not unusual for specific negotiations between nations to take as their point of reference documents emanating from the General Assembly or the Security Council, documents which, after much talking around the matter, must be taken into account in order to achieve a satisfactory settlement. Over the years, and perhaps imperceptibly, the General Assembly, the Secretariat and the other principal organs of the United Nations have acquired skill in negotiation, a sense of proportion in the exchange ofideas and precision in the use of methods for promoting compromises and avoiding confrontation. This maturing of the international system is beginning to bear lasting fruit in terms of the preservation of international peace and security. 5. In a world in which the storms of history have swept away institutions and ideas which for centuries governed the life of societies, thereby increasing conflicts and geographical shifts in power, only an organization such as the United Nations can create the necessary conditions for averting the catastrophes that can befall mankind in an era in which science and technology-the highest products of human intelli· gence-have placed in the hands of States weapons of such destructive power that they could, if used in a moment ofmadness, jeopardize the very survivalofthe species. 6. World peace and security are therefore the great cause of the United Nations. This is our feeling today, 40 years afterthe Second World War was launched with the aggression against a heroic and defenceless nation, Poland, a war which came to represent mankind's cruellest experience, with the snuffing out ofmillions of lives and the creation of an atmosphere of hatred which shook all the cultures and civilizations established up to that time. 7. The negotiations which have been carried on here in the quest for legal instruments to safeguard peace give us some cause for optimism. The same can be said of the atmosphere in which the discussions on disarma· ment are be109 conducted, and especially of the widespread recognition of the need to reach agreements to limit the production of, and traffic in, nuclear and con· ventional weapons. There is, still, however, valid con· cem over the ever-growing economic dependence of a number of industrialized countries on arms production and sales. There is also unanimous criticism ofthe arms race, which compels States poor in economic resources to devote to the insatiable acquisition ofthe implements of war substantial portions of their budgets, which should be used to improve the social conditions oftheir peoples. 8. The international community is concerned also over the appearance of ominous signs concerning the economy. Oil, a raw material which was thought to be in limitless supply and which, as a result, some hedonistic societies have wasted and continue to waste improvidently, is beginning to run out. Naturally, the price ofoil is rising in every market. We are discovering that this fossil fuel is the very basis of a style of civilization whose days now seem to be numbered, and there is no doubt that we should prepare ourselves for a future whose shape is yet uncertain. The developing countries, in particular, owing to the form of their economic systems and their scanty international currency holdings, will not be able to meet the heavy cost of fuel. This new and unexpected circumstance will accentuate the inequalities suffered by the developing countries. 9. Parallel with this situation, we should note that little I?rogress has been made by UNCTAD and in the ne~otlations tn the so-called North-South dialogue. ThIS stagnation is discouraging, for the developing countries have seen their plans to improve the conditions of their peoples undermined by deterioration of the terms of trade, the neo-protectionism practised by wealthy countries, the miserly transfer of technology and the cold selfishness ofsome powerful States. I trust that at the 1980 special session ofthe General Assembly devoted to the establishment of a new international economic order it will be possible to bridge the gap between opposing positions and reach an agreement by consensus, which will constitute a major advance towards greater equity in international economic relations. 10. The last regular session was marked by the participation in the general debate of more States than ever before in the history ofthe Organization. It was also characterized by the special attention it devoted to problems which have long been on the agenda, but are no less important for all that-the changing situation in the Middle East, the defence ofthe inalienable rights of the Palestinian people, the liberation of Namibia, the struggle against apartheid, and stabilization in the Far East. The session was also marked by an encouraging return in a number of regions to political forms whose reaffirmation signifies respect for the human person and the inherent rights of every human being. In order to give impetus to that process, the Latin American countries, I have been informed, will submit for the consideration ofthe General Assembly a plan for assistance to Nicaragua, the heroic Central American nation which has made sacrifices in human lives and material losses for its unshakeable determination to attain political freedom. 11. As we begin this new session we have before us a provisional agenda which includes 124 items covering the major problems of concern to States. Some ofthese items are of major importance for the preservation of international peace and security; others, for the achievement of a more equitable distribution of the world's wealth; still others, for assuring the enjoyment by peoples of independence and the exercise of selfdetermination, or for creating conditions which will enable human beings to live in an atmosphere ofdignity commensurate with their high spiritual level. On the basis of the experience acquired in my year of serving as President ofthe General Assembly, I have no doubt that the delegations attending this session will work with their usual zeal, wisdom and dedication to promote the welfare of the peoples of the world. 12. Before concluding, I wish to associate the General Assembly with the grief felt by all of us at the death of Mr. Agostinho Neto, the President of the People's Republic of Angola. Poet, warrior, statesman and leader of his people, he unquestionably represents the generation of African leaders who in recent years have led their nations to independence and the realization of their full political destiny. 13. Lastly, it remains for me only to express gratitude once again, on behalf of my country Colombia and on my own behalf, for the honour done me by my election to the presidency of the thirty-third session of the United Nations General Assembly in 1978. This office is an honour to anyone, whatever his merits and achievements may be, and [shall keep happy memories of the deference and cordial understanding always shown me by the delegations ofeach and every Member State."
10193,"Margaret Thatcher, PM Inauguration Speech",https://www.margaretthatcher.org/document/103924,Margaret Thatcher,Prime Minister (United Kingdom),Inauguration Speech,1979,,"The British Transport Docks Board, the nationalised ports sector, says that, on average, traffic at its ports is down 40 per cent. Practically no containers are getting in and out of Southampton. The rail strike has added to the burden. [column 1525] The report from the Confederation of British Industry is that many firms are being strangled. There is a shortage of materials. They cannot move their own products. Exports are being lost. It says that secondary picketing, picketing of firms not in dispute, is very heavy all over the country. It is particularly affecting such items as packaging materials and sugar and all vital materials necessary if industry is to keep going. Lay-offs known to the CBI are at least 125,000 already, and there are expected to be 1 million by the end of the week. There are telegrams and telexes from many companies saying that their exports are not being allowed through and that they might lose the orders for ever. There are messages from firms such as Marks and Spencer which last week lost 20 per cent. of its food production, approximately £2 million. Unless secondary pickets are removed this week the estimate is of a 30 per cent. loss. Over last week and this week and this week, unless there is a change, the company says that it will not shift 50 per cent. of its exports. The food industry in particular is shambolic. There is pressure on edible oils, yeast, salt, sugar and packaging materials. No maize came through Tilbury yesterday. Associated Biscuits has already laid off 1,500 people in Huyton and 400 in Southampton and will lay off more by the weekend. Cold stores are laying off people, and all large oil mills in Hull were picketed yesterday, except the one visited by BBC television. If that is not mounting chaos, it is difficult to see what is. The strikes today are not the only ones we have experienced recently. The tanker drivers' strike, thank goodness, is over. We have had the bread strike, hospital strikes, strikes at old people's homes, and strikes in newspapers, broadcasting, airports and car plants. Many people who thought previously that strikes were a characteristic only of large firms and that most firms were strike-free received a rather rude shock from a new piece of work by the Social Science Research Council, a Government-financed body, which found that nearly half our factories had some form of industrial conflict, stoppages, overtime bans and go-slows in the past two years; and [column 1526]nearly one-third suffered from all-out strikes. This is the picture in Britain today, and the troubles will not be over when the immediate strikes are settled. Not only are there more problems in the pipeline but many of the problems arising from the present strikes will carry on for very much longer than the strikes themselves. Many export orders might never be regained. Companies and firms which have struggled hard to get them may have to lay off their workers. Some of the small firms upon which Britain depends so much may be forced into bankruptcy and they, too, will have to lay off their workers. It was interesting to hear on the BBC this morning a typical road haulage man who said that he knew what he could afford. He could survive only about another four days because he was already losing £1,000 a day. What is our approach to this grievous strike situation? Unlike the Prime Minister, we do not go around supporting strikes when we are in Opposition. We never have and we never shall. These things are a weapon of the present Government party and the nation is reaping a bitter harvest from the attitude and approach that they have taken. The Prime Minister will not like it, but it is pertinent that he should be reminded exactly of the attitude he took in the miners' strike during our phase 3. The offer was approximately the same as that being offered by the road haulage employers now. When the miners were being offered 16 per cent., the Prime Minister said this of Edward Heathmy predecessor: “Unless he has more money to put on the table, he has a bigger struggle on his hands than he has ever imagined. Mr. Heath is arguing that he is fighting inflation. That is utter drivel.”
The Prime Minister obviously expects the Opposition not to follow his example. Indeed, we shall not follow that example. We shall act responsibly, and he is very fortunate that we shall do so. No one on this side of the House will be urging the road hauliers to pay more. No one will be quoting the minimum amounts that they are paid. They are much more likely to believe the comments of many lorry drivers, heard on radio and television, that their regular pay varies from £75 to £100 a week. [column 1527] The Prime Minister's answer to all our troubles is a statistic—X per cent. This year it is to be 5 per cent. But we cannot have rigid pay policies for ever. That is not a possible way of conducting affairs in a free country which has a great deal of varied industry and where industry must always be changing to keep abreast of the times and one step ahead of competitors if we are to survive. It is not a possible way. It is not even possible in the way that the Government propose to carry out their present policies. There is no way in which it will work. I thought that that was admitted by Michael Footthe Lord President of the Council on television last Sunday during a very long interview. He pointed out that the low-paid workers would get far more than 5 per cent. That had already been arranged. We know that under schedule 11 to the Employment Protection Act workers just above the low-paid level can use that provision to break through any incomes policy and to get higher pay because other people in the area are getting higher pay. The Prime Minister introduced that schedule and that legislation. It was part of the price he paid to the unions for the earlier stages of incomes policy. He knows and we know that unless he has proper provisions for differentials for people who take the trouble to acquire extra skills, knowing the years this takes, industry cannot be kept going because we shall not have the skilled labour that we need. His policy cannot and will not work. The Prime Minister said this afternoon, when tackling the problem of inflation, that he believed in money supply. That is common ground between us. Five years of Labour Government have debased the coinage to a greater extent than have any other Government for three centuries. That is not in dispute; opinion as to how or why it came about may be. The right hon. Gentleman knows and I know that unless he holds the money supply inflation will mount again. He knows and I know that if he goes on spending money at the rate at which the Government are spending at the moment and goes on borrowing the amount the Government are borrowing at the moment interest rates will be very high indeed and industry will be in considerable trouble. It already is. That is not the way to get productivity going. [column 1528] The right hon. Gentleman knows equally that the real problem is that we have lived through a long period of increasing trade union power. That period has been characterised by a series of what I would call package deals between the Government and the unions in which the Government have offered certain advantages in return for certain co-operation. The trouble has been that the advantages have tended to become permanent and enshrined in legislation, and the co-operation only temporary. In fact, the package deals got unpacked. That happened even with some of ours, as there were a number of advantages for the unions in the Industrial Relations Act. A good deal of the restraints were abolished by the present Government. It has been a very unequal situation. That time of mounting power for the trade unions has also been a period when we have seen increasing Left-wing militancy in control of the unions. [Hon. Members: “No” .] Yes, we have, and the country knows it. The right hon. Member for Huyton (Sir H. Wilson knows it, the Prime Minister knows it, and the people in the rank and file of the unions know it. Just at a time—— made the dispute official and is taking a hand in it. That is the reality of the situation. The right hon. Lady's arguments are pure fantasy. The hon. Gentleman suffers from the fact that I understand him perfectly. He knows as well as I do that perhaps one of the reasons that this strike was made official was that it was already out of control. It went out of control because of the mounting Left-Wing nature of that union. We have been through a period of increasing trade union power. The unions have had unique power and unique power requires unique responsibility. That responsibility has not been forthcoming. That is the reason for the position in [column 1529]which the country finds itself today—about which they can be no dispute. There has already been a good deal of comment and argument between the two sides on the vexed matter of picketing, which is playing an enormous part in these strikes. Merlyn ReesThe Home Secretary had a go yesterday. He said two things with which I want to quarrel immediately. I do not like quarelling with the Home Secretary, but he gives one many opportunities to do so in some of the things he says. He said, first, that, apart from one difference in the law which the Government side brought in, the law on picketing had remained the same. The difference which he said that the Government side brought in is that one cannot now picket at a person's home. That was not brought in by the Labour Party. It was brought in by the Industrial Relations Act——It was in the 1974 Act, but it was not an improvement, or a greater protection to people in their homes, brought in by the Labour Party. It was introduced by the Conservative Party in the 1971 Act and it was one of the things that the Labour Government retained. So the right hon. Gentleman was wrong on that.
He also said: “I have no power to instruct chief constables in their duties.” —[Official Report, 15th January 1979; Vol. 960, c. 1323.] He has power to send a circular to chief constables. Does he not remember, when we had debates and emergencies before, his right hon. Friend Shirley Williamsthe Secretary of State for Education and Science debating with my right hon. Friend the Member for Chipping Barnett (Mr. Maudling) at the time when he was Home Secretary? The right hon. Lady said: “That is why I welcome, but regard as very late indeed, his—— my right hon. Friend's— “circular to chief constables, which was sent out last Friday giving advice on what steps they should take.—[Official Report, 14th February, 1972; Vol. 831, c. 48.] The Home Secretary should be giving advice on the present grievous difficulties.
[column 1530]
Will the right hon. Gentleman give the chief constables advice by means of a circular? Why has he not done so already? He has power to give advice in a circular and, in view of the seriousness of the situation, he should already be doing it. We on this side take the view that it is far better to take emergency powers early rather than leave it until the situation has escalated. That is the practice that we followed. Emergency powers were usually taken comparatively early. The negotiations with industry should now have been completed on what regulations it would be necessary to add to the corps which is already there, ready and waiting, under the Emergency Powers Act 1920. I doubt whether those steps have been taken and I think that that is why the right hon. Gentleman is not bringing in emergency powers as the position is now. When one has those powers there is no need suddenly to use the Army. The Army is there if the contingency plans have all been properly made. May I continue on the question of the law on picketing? Apart from the one change to which the Home Secretary referred, which we made, he is right to say that the law on the nature of picketing has not changed for a very long time. The best exposition that I know on this—it is not for me to lay down what it is or what it is not—is an exposition given by the Conservative Attorney-General, then Sir Peter Rawlinson, now Lord Rowlinson, in a speech in September 1972. He went into it in language which is so simple that one would not have thought that a lawyer could have written it. He set out very well the position on the nature of picketing. The only right is that of peaceful persuasion. There is no right to stop a vehicle. There is no right to threaten loss of a union card. There is no right to intimidate. There is no right to obstruct, and numbers themselves can be intimidating. He also pointed out what few other people have said—that every person in this country has a right to go about his daily work [column 1531]or pleasure free from interference by anyone else. That right is not being exerted or exercised at the moment. My right hon. and noble Friend also pointed out: “The right to proceed about one's lawful business is not in any way subordinate to the right of peacefully persuading. This has always been the case.”
So the right of a person to do as he wishes should be upheld by the police and by this Government. But now we find that the place is being practically run by strikers' committees and that they are using such language as “allowing” access to food, “allowing” certain lorries to go through. They have no right to prevent them from going through. They have no right to stop them. Lorry drivers should look to the Government and all the agencies of government to protect their right, first, not to stop if they do not wish it and, secondly, to go through to the docks or anywhere else with their loads. That is not happening and it is most reprehensible that firmer steps are not being taken by the Government to protect the ordinary citizen's right to go about his lawful business.
Some disturbing reports are coming in from parts of the country about what is happening. I am getting a large number. I am pledged not to use any names, so——We on this side respect confidence. Of course the hon. Member would like names, would he not? At no stage, even though frequently invited to do so, did I support the Ford strike. It was a strike in breach of an agreement. We on this side believe that unions should uphold their agreements as a matter of honour. I have not finished with what the hon. Gentleman said. The argument that I am developing now is that there is no right to intimidate any citizen in this country. But that intimidation is taking place. I propose to use actual reports in the press in which names are given. They are substantiated by many telegrams. I am not prepared to mention names, because that is what a number of people would like me to do—and then those concerned would be exposed to intimidation as well.
It is reported in The Daily Telegraph today—[Hon. Members: “Ah!” ] This relates to the animal feed compounders, a very important group. I thought that everyone recognised that it was important for food to get through to animals—but it is not, apparently, recognised by Labour Members below the Gangway. The spokesman states: “‘We are finding that essential ingredients—fat, salt and vitamins—are not being allowed through in a number of cases.’”
They are not being “allowed” through. The report continues: “‘It is a very alarming situation.’
One Reading feed firm was told its nonunion driver would have to pay £16.64, a year's membership subscription to the Transport and General Workers' Union, before he would be allowed in to collect animal feed at Southampton docks. Mr. Charles Cooper, a director of the firm, Walter Parsons and Sons, said: ‘I think it's blackmail. I thought this was a free country. If our chaps want to join a union, they can. We don't see why we should force a chap to join’.” No union has any right whatsoever to do that. I believe that it is an offence against the law to do it. Action should be taken to ensure that lorry drivers are not threatened and to ensure that they are not told that they cannot get through unless they have a union card or take one out. One of the problems about the present law on the nature of picketing is that it is extremely difficult to enforce. Intimidation and violence are unlawful. I believe that intimidation and violence are happening and are a daily occurrence. If the present law is unenforceable, we must change it so that it becomes enforceable. If the Prime Minister wishes to embark upon that, we shall certainly support him. Merlyn ReesThe Home Secretary said that the law has not changed. He was being less than [column 1533]complete in his assessment of the law. The law on the nature of picketing has not changed, but the law on the occasions when and places where it can take place has changed. It was changed by this Government.
There were considerable debates in the House during the passage of the Trade Union and Labour Relations Acts of 1974 and 1976. Hitherto the position was that trade unions had immunities from the process of the law only provided, first, that there was a trade dispute and, secondly, that the immunity applied only in the case of a contract of employment. That was all. But that was not good enough for this Government. They extended the immunity of trade unions in a vital way. They made trade unions immune in a trade dispute not only in relation to a breach of contract of employment but in relation to breach of any commercial contract whatsoever. There were constant arguments in Standing Committee on this matter. The Government were warned what would happen if they took that action. A long letter from Campbell Adamson was published in The Times and was quoted during those proceedings. Campbell Adamson was not exactly the staunchest ally of the Conservative Party. He said: “If the Bill is passed as at present drafted, unions … will be free in law … to ‘black’, blockade or boycott, or threaten to do so, whenever they like … in respect of a trade dispute anywhere in Great Britain or in the rest of the world. Secondly, it will be lawful to use the picket line for the purpose of establishing boycotts or blockades whether against an employer in dispute or against employers, companies … or bodies which have nothing to do with the dispute in question.”
The Government were warned that if they passed that section of the legislation it would lead to blacking, blockades and boycotts. That is what they wanted and that is what we have got. The hon. Member for Bassetlaw (Mr. Ashton) has made one of the most revealing and significant interventions that I have heard. He is not concerned with legality. He is not concerned with protecting the rights of the ordinary citizen to go about his business. He is concerned with the convenience of the trade unions. It is because of that attitude that today many of our citizens have to apply for permits to a strike committee of the Transport and General Workers' Union. That is exactly what this Government have landed our people in. It is totally and utterly wrong.
The Government have changed the law on picketing—not on the nature of picketing but on the extent. They were warned what would happen. It has happened and they are responsible for it in large measure. Of course I shall. I am only too delighted to do so. Hon. Members are being most helpful. Does the Leader of the Opposition agree that she has missed out two important sections of society—members of the British Medical Association and members of the associations for the legal professions? They operate a closed shop and, above all, unlike trade unions, operate their own kangaroo courts. Neither the Law Society nor the Bar Council operates a closed shop. The hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East (Mr. Swain) should read the last presidential address of the current president of the Law Society. Of course people must acquire qualifications. That is different. A solicitor does not have to belong to the Law [column 1535]Society to practise as a solicitor. A barrister does not have to belong to the Bar Council to practise as a barrister. A doctor does not have to belong to the British Medical Association to practise as a doctor. I understand from a number of the Prime Minister's comments about picketing that he does not like the present situation either. We do not always judge the Prime Minister by what he says because he does different things. Most of us did not like what happened at Grunwick, but he did not stop his Ministers joining that picket line. That picketing involved numbers, and numbers themselves can be intimidating—that is apart from the violence. The Secretaries of State Shirley Williamsfor Education and Science and Fred Mulleyfor Defence joined the picket line when they were not involved in the dispute in any way. The right hon. Lady was not involved in that dispute. She was not in dispute with anyone, so far as I know. Nevertheless, she added her presence to the picket line and added to the numbers, when numbers themselves can be intimidating. The right hon. Lady concedes that she went on the picket line. I should never accuse her of wanting or condoning violence. However, she was not in dispute. She ought never to have gone on that picket line. Her action encouraged others to turn up in larger numbers. When one of my hon. Friends tackled the Prime Minister about that during Prime Minister's Questions he said that he hoped that others, including Opposition Members, would join that picket line. [column 1536] The Prime Minister does not have exactly the world's best record on picketing. In a more recent quotation he said: “Not crossing the picket line has become an expression of solidarity to a degree which I certainly did not know in my younger days when I was an active trade unionist. But that kind of solidarity if carried to extremes means that life could seize up in a closely knit industrial society such as our own.” —[Official Report, 1st November 1978; Vol. 957, c. 53.] It seems that the right hon. Gentleman, too, is having second thoughts. If he is, if he will carry out an inquiry and investigation into picketing and will undertake, first, to repeal the extension of the law that his Government introduced and, secondly, will ascertain how both the law and practice may be changed to ensure that we do not have the problems that we are now encountering, the Opposition will support him. Closely allied to picketing and the giving of tremendous power is the powerful weapon of the closed shop. I do not say that it allows pickets to intimidate because they are not allowed to do so, but in practice it enables them to intimidate. At present we cannot catch that and take it to the courts. It is illegal. It is the most powerful weapon for any group to have. When a lorry driver meets a line of pickets he may be alone in the cab. Therefore, he has to face a line of pickets alone. He can be identified because of the number of his lorry and the name on it. He is so fearful that he is almost bound to stop. As one driver said, “What choice have I? Who will stand up for me when I am sacked?” In the vexed and vital area of the closed shop the Government have enhanced the powers of the trade unions. They have made it legal to have a statutory closed shop. They have made it legal for the unions to ensure that a person may be sacked from his job without compensation and without right of appeal to the courts of law. That is what the Government have done to enhance and increase the powers of trade unions. The Government have introduced legislation that allows picketing to take place at a greater number of places. The picketing that we now see taking place and the closed shop provisions have put into the hands of trade unions a considerable weapon leading to violence, and to intimidation that we cannot detect. [column 1537] I want to remove all possibility of violence on picket lines. I want to re-establish the circumstances under which people may go about their business without interference and without fear of losing their jobs. At present they are in grave fear. The Prime Minister has been saying various things about the closed shop. He voted to change the earlier legislation but he has been making new statements about the closed shop. On 12th July 1977 he said: “I always took the view that there was a right not to belong to a trade union, when I was a trade unionist myself, and I take that view now.” —[Official Report, 12th July 1977; Vol. 935, c. 219.] If he wishes to repeal the legislation that his Government enacted, we shall support him in doing so. If he will bring forward proposals to mitigate the effects of the closed shop, again we shall support him in doing so. If he asks the unions to minimise its effects, we shall support him in that approach. It is not impossible to do that. It has just been done at County Hall. At the instance of Horace Cutler about 17 unions have entered into a new agreement at County Hall which means that the closed shop in its present form will not continue. What has been achieved is one of the greatest breakthroughs under present Conservative government in the GLC. If the Prime Minister will secure similar agreements for all unions under all circumstances, it will be a great advance. Let me tell the Prime Minister what has been agreed. Horace Cutler said: “What we have now agreed is that any worker who genuinely objects to trade union membership on the grounds of religious belief or personal conviction can opt out without question; that there will be no ‘Star Chamber’ type of inquisition into the genuineness of such belief; and that any worker opting out will make a charitable donation equivalent to the trade union subscription.” [column 1538] The Government made the closed shop possible and legal in circumstances in which it would never have been possible and legal before. They enabled trade unions to compel a person to lose his job without compensation if he refused to join a union. If the Prime Minister will secure by agreement that each and every person who does not want to join a trade union because of personal conviction is able to opt out, we shall support him. If he will undo some of the measures that he supported to give greater power through the closed shop provisions of the 1974 and 1976 Acts, we shall support him. He has a chance. We shall now see whether his statements that he is against the closed shop and that there is a right not to belong to a trade union were meant in the sense that he is prepared to take action, or whether they were mere talk. If he takes steps to minimise the closed shop provisions, we shall support him. Of course I am not undermining my argument. The hon. Gentleman knows that. I believe passionately that no one should be compelled to join a trade union as a condition of keeping his job. The Government do not share that belief. The Government believe—they introduced legislation to this effect—that a person should be compelled to join a trade union and that if he does not he should lose his job. That is in the 1974 and 1976 legislation. The hon. Gentleman knows that people who have worked for British Rail for years in a perfectly satisfactory manner have lost their jobs without compensation because the Government passed legislation that enabled that to happen. We must seek to change the law and the extent to which the trade unions seek to operate it. I appreciate, Mr. Speaker, that I am taking rather a lot of time but I am not [column 1539]occupying all of it by a long chalk. If the Prime Minister will do something to reverse the effect of the 1974 and 1976 Acts which his Government and his predecessor's Government enacted, we shall support him. Another complaint that is frequently made is that we cannot have free collective bargaining—I stress that we have always used the term “realistic and responsible collective bargaining” —between two sides when there is no true balance of power between the sides. There is a great deal in that argument. If we are to be able to bargain freely, there must be a pretty good balance of power between the two parties to the bargaining. That is why the powers of trade unions were strengthened many years ago when the employee was very much on the adverse side of the balance. Today it is the employer who is on the adverse side. In many instances—this is not known by Labour Members sitting below the Gangway—a strike of three to four weeks can put an employer totally and utterly out of business, although it may scarcely affect the income of those who previously worked for him. Until that balance is a true balance once again, I believe it will be difficult, if not impossible, to get free collective bargaining. Every freedom—trade union freedom as well—requires very grave responsibility in its exercise. I can see what will happen. Unless the Prime Minister is prepared to redress the balance of trade union power so that there is an even balance between the two sides, what he is going for will be a State in which one can never get free collective bargaining and in which he will try to have incomes policies year after year. This will mean that industry in this country seizes up and we never reach that state of prosperity to which our talents and abilities entitle us. A good deal has been said about the way that the PAYE system works, but I might point out that the most obvious way to deal with this problem is one which Denis Healeythe Chancellor will never take. If one did not pay so much in tax out of one's pay packet, there would not be as much to come back during a strike. But the Labour Party is the party of high personal income tax. It increases it every time it is in power, and it has [column 1540]many effects. It means that people have no incentive to work harder and it means—this is another side effect—that people look at their net take-home pay and demand bigger pay increases than they would otherwise get if they paid less tax. Some unions are so powerful that they are able to deprive the community of the essentials of life, and there are people in some occupations who would not go on strike at all. The Army would not, nor would the police, and we should be very grateful to them for their loyalty in all kinds of situations. Are there not other unions whose members' work is so essential that one would expect them to be prepared to enter into no-strike agreements? Would it not be reasonable to take them out of the usual processes of bargaining in return for different methods which could be negotiated with them? I heard someone say “water” . I know that we went against the Donovan report and took away the limitation on striking in the water, electricity and gas industries. Some of us now think, with hindsight, that we were ill-advised to do that, but the nature of the prohibition was a criminal sanction which we did not like. Moreover, it had not been used for many years. There was a third reason, that people could get round the strike provision and have goslows or overtime bans. Donovan recommended keeping that limitation to remind people that there were particular occupations which were not entitled to inflict immense harm and damage on the community out of all proportion to their numbers. What I am suggesting to the Prime Minister is that he enters into negotiations with some of the unions to see whether he could get a no-strike arrangement in return for a different method of bargaining which they would find satisfactory. Again, if he does that we will support him. Doubtless the Prime Minister now regrets his attitude to “In Place of Strife” . We certainly regretted his attitude in 1974 when he pledged to do away with the Industrial Relations Act and to enact new legislation which, in his own words, Labour had already agreed with the TUC. We are concerned with the well-being of all our people. The question of the [column 1541]powers of unions in relation to the community, Parliament and the law has been raised again by events and by crises which even the Prime Minister cannot ignore. While we are very critical of his complacency, and while we are critical of the way in which matters have hardened and he has not been prepared to take the requisite action, and while we are critical of much of his political philosophy, if he will take steps to deal with the situation of trade union power and consider new laws and new practices against picketing, of alleviating the effect of the closed shop and of trying to achieve more secret ballots so that people do not go on strike before they have been consulted about a matter which affects their whole livelihood—if he will agree to take action on these issues, we will support him through and through. We believe that this is a matter of great significance for democracy and a free society, and we will support him if he will take steps to deal with these problems. I hope he will set them in hand soon. May I point out that this is a more generous offer than he ever made to us when we were in government. I hope that he will take those steps. If he does not, I hope that he will step aside for a party that will. It would help if the right hon. Gentleman were to repeal the 1976 Act which his Government passed. I will come to that particular point a little later. I do not think it would help. I have read the recent comments of the hon. and learned Member for Cleveland and Whitby (Mr. Brittan) and of the right hon. Member for Lowestoft (Mr. Prior). They have spoken in the last week about this matter of picketing. They have referred to the need for a voluntary code of conduct. Certainly I believe that that would have a better chance of survival than ill-considered legal provisions, which could be ignored in the future as they have been in the past. There is the example—it was referred to earlier—of the position in 1972 with Arthur Scargill and the Saltley coke works, which led the National Union of Mineworkers in 1974 to lay down voluntarily strict rules governing the conduct of picketing. These controls were effective. Why? Because they had the force of law? No. These controls were effective because they were voluntarily agreed measures, drawn up by the union itself and accepted by its members. They could not have been enforced if they had not been accepted by those concerned, or if there had been competing factions, for example, within the union who did not accept the overall decision. But the National Union of Mineworkers has usually—indeed, I would say almost invariably—accepted decisions of this nature when they are taken, and it did so on that occasion. What I am saying to the House, and what I beg the House to believe, is that the law is only a second—no, a third—best in these circumstances unless we have the agreement and consent of those who are bound together. [column 1549] As the House knows, the Secretary of State for Employment has given a lot of consideration to the question of picketing. Last October he sent to a number of bodies, such as the TUC, the CBI, and to the right hon. Member for Lowestoft, the Scottish National Party, the Liberal Party, and others, including ACAS, a series of proposals for trying to clarify the issue of picketing, to try to turn it into something that would be generally acceptable and would not result in the kind of position that we have seen today. It is a prickly subject and, as the present position shows, a little progress has been made in the comments that we have had so far from some of those whom we have asked to give us the benefit of their advice. My right hon. Friend has asked them to expedite their replies, and the Government intend that we should proceed as quickly as we can to draw up a code of conduct that will adhere to some of the principles I outlined at the beginning of my remarks. My right hon. Friend will report progress to the House on this matter from time to time. I come now to the question of the law, which the right hon. Lady raised. It has been suggested by other Tory spokesmen that industrial relations legislation which this Administration introduced has made secondary picketing more likely because of the repeal of the Conservative Administration's Industrial Relations Act 1971. The Conservative Administration put that Act on the statute book in good faith, with the intention that it should introduce a system which they hoped would be fair between the unions, the employers and the public, but let us recall what was the basic underlying purpose of the Act. It was to make most strikes and picketing actionable. That was the purpose of the Act. People came under the law directly in that sense. What happened? Some action was taken. I hardly like to remind the House that five picketers were arrested, five picketers were charged, five picketers were imprisoned, and the Official Solicitor was called in to get them out. It was during the lifetime of the Industrial Relations Act that secondary and flying picketing became the nuisance that it is today. The legislative change which we have made, which it is alleged has made secondary picketing easier, is that [column 1550]in the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Amendment) Act 1976 the immunity, as the right hon. Lady correctly said, for acts done in contemplation or furtherance of a trade dispute was extended to inducement to break a contract instead of, as previously, only a contract of employment. That was the extension that was made. The right hon. Lady says that this was intended to give great new powers to the unions and was part of the whole ethos. The truth is that this change was made because of a number of court decisions in the late 1960s. These decisions had made the application of the law extremely unclear. This was commented upon by Lord Donovan who said in his report that whether legal liability was or was not incurred depended on—and here I quote the words of the report— “whether a legal maze is successfully threaded or not.” That was the result. As it was drafted, the Act was acting capriciously and inequitably between differ, ent groups of workers and in different industries. I have examined this carefully, and in the light of the experience that we have had it is highly doubtful, if the change-back was made, whether this would effectively curtail secondary picketing. I still recall the Trade Disputes and Trade Unions Act 1927. That Act provided for the , measure that the right hon. Lady has asked us to reinstate. I was deeply opposed to it because it prevented Civil Service unions from being affiliated to the TUC. That was eventually repealed. What I would like the right hon. Lady to check is this. The law was totally ignored and unused despite, that provision from 1927 until the time that it was repealed. We must be careful about the law in these matters. I am not in principle opposed to the law in trade union matters. As a Conservative spokesman said the other day, we have introduced more law than almost anybody else. We have done, so, but we must be careful where we go with these laws unless we are to bring them into contempt and ridicule. That surely is not the purpose of the Opposition in putting forward suggestions of this sort. The 1927 Act is one that I well recall, and it is for this reason among others that the , Government believe in and would [column 1551]favour a code of conduct drawn up in any approved way. The right hon. Member for Lowestoft suggested this, but not the right hon. Lady, as I understand it. I am not trying to make a distinction between the two, but I will if the House wants me to, an, d it will not be very difficult. Everybody is trying to think his way through this. I agree with the right hon. Gentleman that a voluntary code of conduct, reaffirming the existing law, would be the best way to proceed as a solution to this problem. I cannot undertake on a long-term issue of this sort, which has been growing up for several years, that a new voluntary code of conduct would be drawn up and agreed within a week. That is not possible. We must try within the limits of the present civil and criminal law to ensure that secondary picketing does not go beyond the proper limits. With the help of the regional officers and the aid of the police, I trust we shall be able to do that. I must pass on. I gave way only 30 seconds ago. I turn now to the question of pay policy. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Employment reports that in this pay round there have so far been 45 major settlements covering 1½ million employees. Thirty of those settlements, covering 800,000 employees, are within the guidelines. At least eight settlements covering over half a million employees are not within the guidelines. I add that most of those in breach had settlements within single figures, although, since the Government's defeat on sanctions in December and our consequent withdrawal, the situation has worsened. Some offers are being made of more than 10 per cent. and productivity conditions are being dropped from the offers. Up to the time of the sanctions debate there were two highly publicised, confirmed breaches—Ford and British [column 1552]Oxygen. These breaches, together with the oil tanker drivers and now the road haulage drivers, tend to set a pattern. There is a knock-on effect, an attempt to set a going rate. Everybody who has anything to do with negotiations knows that this is true. I shall enumerate some of the agreements that were outside the limits just to give an indication of where they were. There were the merchant seamen at 8¾ per cent., British Oxygen at 9½ per cent., motor vehicle repair workers at 8 per cent., narrow fibre workers at 8 per cent., and electrical contracting workers at 10½ per cent. It could be claimed that this kind of settlement, although not in accord with the Government's views of the best results for the country as a whole, would not be regarded as totally intolerable. But experience has shown that when there have been some highly publicised breaches the knock-on effect works through subsequent negotiations and indeed accelerates. This is the problem and the issue that the country has to face today. I draw the attention of the House and of the country to the warnings—the awful warning in some ways—of 1975. At the start of the pay round—history can judge the reason for it and what effect the money supply had—we had some settlements in double figures. There were those who considered this tolerable, just as we now consider that we can perhaps tolerate something that we do not really want. The settlements started in double figures, but they gradually built on each other. By the end of the year, by the end of the round, settlements were not just in double figures. They had rocketed to over 30 per cent. The right hon. Lady said nothing about this this afternoon. She said not a word about it, but here, in a sentence, is the reason why the Government do not intend, wherever they have influence, to depart from the guidelines they have laid down and which are best for the country as a whole. I noted what the right hon. Lady said about not encouraging the road haulage workers in any way at all. The discussion on their pay has all been in terms of basic rate. I will repeat the figures accurately as I do not wish to mis-state them. Their basic rate is £53 a week. They have been offered a further £7 to bring this rate up to £60. They are on strike for an extra [column 1553]£12 a week to bring it up to £65. On the basis of overtime and bonus payments, their present average earnings are £84 a week. The offer made to them would increase those earnings to £95 a week—that is, by £11 a week. If they were to get the £65 a week basic rate, their average earnings would increase from £84 to £103 a week—an increase of £19 a week or nearly £1,000 a year. I put it another way—the increase they would get is as much as a single old-age pensioner has to live on in the course of a week. Is that reasonable? Is this what free collective bargaining is about? It is my experience that every group of workers has some particular problem that affects them and them alone. I have never known a case that is not unique. These are matters that must be dealt with by negotiation. The road haulage workers' union has already negotiated an increase of about 15 per cent. this year. That is too high, in our view, for the health of the economy. These workers also received 15 per cent. a year ago at a time when inflation was running at 8 per cent. a year. They have had tax cuts like everyone else and increase in child benefit and children's allowances, yet now they say they will not settle for less than 22 per cent. I have no doubt what the answer should be in those circumstances. They have had a better deal than could have been expected and they should now go back to work. No, I shall not give way at the moment. We now face claims in the public services from the local authority manual workers, the water workers, National Health Service ancillary workers, ambulance men, railwaymen, postmen, steel workers, gas supply workers, electricity supply workers and miners. These settlements are crucial to the future health of our country. The Government's policy is that the country should not go through once again what it went through four or five years ago. We shall adhere as closely as possible to the pay limits that have been laid down. We are at present seeing the first bitter fruits of free collective bargaining. We have been deprived, by the vote of the House, of the instruments we were using to influence the holding down of pay settlements. Therefore, we must make the best use of such instruments as are available to us. First, I make it clear that we do not intend, as a Government, to finance inflation. We do not intend to have a situation like that of a few years ago when the money supply snowballed out of control. We intend to adhere to monetary targets, with inevitable effects both on the level of activity in the economy and on the level of unemployment. What has been remarkable so far has been steadiness of sterling. It has not slipped; it has wavered very slightly. As long as the Government are known to be holding to those targets and to this policy, we can be certain that our currency will not slip in the way that it did previously. The Government do not prefer these alternatives. They are not our choice. However, we reject the alternative of allowing inflation to increase unchecked. If we do, we shall all be far worse off in the long run. What would be the result of a small increase—and that is what it would be, only a small increase—in the quantity of money financing very large wage settlements of 20 per cent. or 30 per cent.? There could only be one result—the weakest firms would go to the wall and there would be more unemployment. In addition, instead of easing interest rates the country would be faced with further tightening. These rates are already higher [column 1555]than we would like. A further rise would cause industries and distributors to postpone investment where it has been running high—a 13½ per cent. increase in new investment last year. That will have to be postponed if higher wages are to be paid. Secondly, in the public sector big settlements will push up the public sector wage bill. If settlements in the public sector were at the rate of 15 per cent., public expenditure would increase by more than £2 billion next year. The borrowing requirement would increase, on present estimates, by rather less than £2 billion. If the local authority pay settlements are as much as 10 per cent., domestic rates will increase on average by as much as 18 per cent. If local authority pay settlements are as high as 15 per cent. domestic rates will increase on average by up to 27 per cent. What are the consequences? Excessive pay settlements to public servants will mean worse and poorer services for the public generally. The tragedy will be that, if pay settlements are excessive, there will be cuts in rail services, longer hospital waiting lists, poorer education and fewer jobs. Let us have some sense in this situation. None of us wants to go through this kind of situation again. I warn the House that if we were to increase the borrowing requirement by anything like that figure—and even the Leader of the Opposition would find difficulty in cutting that—sterling would slip. We would then have an increase in inflation once more and we should be off on the same old merry go round, except that it would be a tragedy. We have considered the Government's attitude against this background. I come immediately to the question of low pay. Paragraph 17 of the White Paper correctly labelled “Winning the Battle against Inflation” said that the Government would be ready to see higher percentage increases than 5 per cent. in cases where earnings were less than £44.50 for a normal full-time week. The condition was that those on higher earnings should accept the consequential improvement in the position of the lower paid. This provision was of potential benefit to about 2 million employees—nearly 10 per cent. of the total. [column 1556] At the Labour Party conference at Blackpool where this policy was rejected, a number of delegates said that the Government had not gone far enough for the lower paid. I indicated that this was a matter on which the Government would be prepared to talk further with others, including the TUC. We had those talks and I regret that the result was not ratified by the General Council. Nevertheless, the Government have continued to give further thought to this matter. We have concluded that we should go further in an attempt to ease the situation and help the lowest paid. Therefore, we propose that, in addition to the existing exception of those earning up to £44.50 for a normal full-time week, there should be a "

During the past year there has beel1 a strong real1ïl'111ation of the importance of the Geneml Assembly <lS a vital forum in which scrious attcmpts can bl"" made to resolve global problel11s. The ract that somctÎmes we do not agree.
or come up lmmedlateîy with solutions, should not obscure the importance of the General Assembly and the significance of the efforts of the United Nations,
The strength of the United Nations is in the principles for whlch lt stands. These principles underlie our vision of the future as weIl as the foundations for harmonious interaction among nations. We ail subscribe to the principle of the equality of inde pendent sovereign States; we ail subscribe to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights; we ail subscribe to the principle of the equality and dignity of aIl human beings, irrespective of l'ace, colour, creed or sex; we are opposed to racial discrimination under any form or p~ct,e.xt;. we are committed to the advancement ofthe quality 01 hte for ail people; and, by our very membership in the l!nited Nations, we are committed to conciliation, negotiatlon, peaceful coexistence and the preservation of international peace and security. These, and more, constitute the purpose of and the need for the United Nations.
These are not goals to be achieved at once. These are goals and objectives for which every generation has to strive. They ~onstitute a permanent agenda and challenge for humamty. We cannot be naïve or simplistic and expect that we can ,achieve th:m in one year, in a decade or in a single generatlOn. What IS needed is a clear vision ofwhere we are going and the ability to create and to capitalize on every opportunity which will bring us closer to our goals. Our greatest challenge is the provision ofvisionary and resourccfui leadership capable of promoting and willing to promote the principles of our Charter.
This century has been blessed with that kind ofleadership. Those who drafted the Charter of the United Nations I~a~ a vi~ion which enabled them to see beyond narrow and Illlllted lllterests. Likewise, 25 years ago, visionary leaders met at Bandungl and saw the needs and future roles of countri.es which until then had found themselves hopeless p~wns 111 the rivalries ofother nations. There the ground was laId for t~e eventual formai bil'th of the non-al igned movement, whlch today exercises tremendous intluenee in worJd affairs.
Our task is to translate their vision into reality through practlcal programmes. Each time we make observable strides in this di~ection should be a cause for joy, a source of hope and a re1l1forecment of our commitment to even greater achievements.
Thus it was a.great moment for ail of us, on 25 August last, at the openmg of the eleventh special session, ta wele~me among us the independent Republie ofZimbabwe. The 1I1.dcpc~dcnc,e of Zimbabwe has a special place in the evoJutlO~ 01 the Il1ternational community. Year aner year, the question of Southern Rhodesia remained on the agendas of the General Assembly and the Security Council. General Assembly resolutiOl~s were sometimes ridiculed as meaningless and ,hollow. ThiS notwithstanding, the General Assembly conslstently upheld the prineiples of the Charter and in the ~nd. was ~indicated thanks to the resilience, courage and declication of the gallant people of Zimbabwe. Zimbabwe is a prized birthday present for the twentieth anniversary of the adoption ofthe Declaration on the Granting of 1ndependence to Colonial COllntries and Peoples. 16. The indcpendence of Zimbabwe is also a lesson for a[] of us. It has demonstrated that with a resourcefll/ and eommitted leadership-in this case the leaders of the people of Zimbabwe-no problem is insurmollntable. The liberation of Zimbabwe also had another signiJicance for us ail. It showed us that, with perseverance, determination and goodwill, the negotiating process can triumph even in the Illûst complex of cireumstances. In a way, the victory in Zimbabwe, like the reeent important breakthrough in the negotiations at the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, eloquently reafflrms the conviction that, with vision, dedication and political will, the most monumental of problems are not beyond solution. The General Assembly must continue to uphold its principles and give encouragement to those who try to give meaning to the Charter's vision, 17. Only yesterday, the General Assembly concluded its eleventh special session, whieh was devoted to a review and appraisal of progress in development and international eeonomic co-operation. That session was convened to deal witll one of the most diflicult yet crucial issues of our time. For some time wc have witnessed a deterioration of the world economic situation as sorne of the pillars of the old world arder have collapsed and others face imminent collapse unless urgent corrective measures are taken. The interdependence of nations is no longer wishful thinking, and the reality and pervasiveness of that interdependence can no longer be ignored. Indeed, it is this perception of interdependence which encouraged us in the 1970s the decline in broad terms the parameters of the new world economic arder. T!le need for such an order, whieh implies major changes 111 power relations, is gradually gaining acceptancc. And yet the translation of the principles ofthe New International Economie Order into praetical programmes to realize the new order remains disturbillgly distant.
The world is not lacking in analytical studies of the pr~sent eeonomie situation. We have the reports of the Dlrector-General for Development and International Economic Co-operation,2 the Brandt Commission,3 the Conference, on International Economie Co-operation,4 several studles by UNCTAD and the Organisation for Economie Co-operation and Development, and many more. What is missing is the politieal will and a spirit of genuine coopt;:ration among nations. Without these, declarations or de~elopmentstra~egies ar~ worth no more than the paper on :-vh1ch they are pnnted; wlthout them, global negotiationslI1deed any negotiations-eannot succced, And where the will to negotiate is demonstrated, experienee has shown that a way can be found to agree on otherwise illtractahle problem~. The cxperience of the just concluded eleven th special se~slon of the General Assembly is in this case very relevant. Glven the political will. it was possible to arrive at a consensus,on the 11.1lernational Development Strategy for the Third Ulllted Nations development deeade\ whieh this Assembly will be forma\ly launching, l'et, at the same time, t11e lack ol the required political will made it impossible for the special session to achieve the expected positive results on the launching of the global negotiations. 19. The need for political will and a spirit of genuine co-operation is perhaps most relevant as we search for solutions to the major political problems of the post-war era. In the Middle East, in Lebanol1, in Cypl'US, in Korea, in South-East Asia, to mention some of the crisis points, peace will continue to elude us unless there is a genuine desire-as weil as the necessary political will-to achieve peace. And tllere cannot be peace unless we respect and abide by the principles of the Charter. 20. Where therc is a deliberate, consistent and deterl11ined e1Iort on the part of any Governl11ent to violate the fundamental tenets which bind us together, where sllch behaviour threatens the well-being of us ail, appropriate I11camrcs should be taken by the international commllnity in the interest of humanity. To do otherwise, or to do nothing, ts ta ridicule the whole purpose of the Organization and to underl11ine its usefulness. 21. The United Nationsshould nevcr compromise its basic principles. There is no basis for compromise on the inhuman policies of apartheid in South Africa, Similarly there can be no compromise on foreign occupation and domination. Nor can there be compromise on the flagrant violation ofhuman rights. In the Middle East we cannot continue to ignore the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination. In this respect, the seventh emergency spccial session of the Generai Assembly, devoted to the question of Palestine, represented the culmination of the joint efforts of the membership to respond positively to the long-frustrated aspirations of the Palestinian people for the cxercise of their inalienable right to self-determination and to achieve the sovereign nationhood they so desire,
In Namibia, South Afriea ShOllld not be allowed to continue its illegal occupation in total detïance of our Organization and international law. Wc must therefore vigorously pursue the objective of the implementation without delay 01' the United Nations plan l'or Namibia.
23. In my opening statement at the eleventh special session"" 1 remarked that the complex economic problems confronting the world today are further compounded by the intcnsified pace of militarization. The arms race continucs unabated. Military cxpenditures are at present conservativcly estimated at $500 billion pelannU11l and this represents a staggering figure, purticlilurly when sct againsl the background of l'<lmpnnt poverty in the grenter part of the world.
24. To compound this trend and the psychosis of suspicion and distrust which it procluccs, the danger l'rom the ever-increasing proliferation of nue/car weapons has become even more acute.
It cannot be denied that our world is now at a critical cl'ossroads and that we must choose betwccn the road which will lead mankind to its own fatal destruction and the road towards mutual understanding, peaceful coexistence, progress and prosperity.
26. These are some of the challenges which we pass on to the next session. They are not easy problems. And yet there is no room for discouragement or despair. We have to continue untiringIy to search for solutions. We should not be discouraged even if in the process we reveal new challenges. Let us continue to build on the roundations which we have; let us resurrect and expand on the spirit of détente; let us respect and abide by the rules and norms of diplomatic intercourse to which we ail subscribe; and let us dedicate and commit ourselves to work for peace, progress and prosperity for all people. 27. During the past year, 1 had the singular honour and privilege of being invited, in my capacity as President of the thirty-fomth session of the General Assembly, to visit cOllntries in all corners of the world. Those visits alTol'ded me a unique opportunity to reœive the wisdom and guidance of many a head of State or Govcrnl11ent and of other higll government officiais on matters affecting world affairs, which are our eommon preoccupation. l derived l'rom them enormous encouragement and inspiration, which have been of great help to me in diseharging the enonnous task of presiding over this important organ of the world Organization. 28. 1 should like to place on record my deep appreciation of the opportllnities thus afforded me and of the warm, cordial and generolls receptioll accorded me by all those Governments withollt exception. My only regret is that, owing to the constraints oftime, it was not possible for me to accept mail the invitations sa kinclly extended to me. To those Governments, 1 wish to express my warm thanks for their kindness. understanding and considemtion. 29. 1 wish also to express my appreciation and gratitude for the help and support whieh l rcceived t'rom the staff or the Secretariat in the course of my duties.

May 21, 1981
The President. Chancellor Schmidt, one of the warmest greetings that Americans can offer in welcoming a guest into their midst is to say, ""Make yourself at home."" On behalf of our fellow citizens, Nancy and I hope that you and Mrs. Schmidt will make yourselves at home during your visit to the United States. We remember with great pleasure how welcome and at home you made us feet on our visit to Germany in 1978.

As you know, millions of German immigrants over the years have made America their home. With strong hands and good hearts, these industrious people helped build a strong and good America. But as proud as they were of this country, they didn't forget their German heritage. They named towns in the New World after those in the Old. The Federal Republic of Germany has just one Bremen; the Federal Republic has one, but we have Bremens in Indiana, in Georgia, and Ohio. And our States are dotted with Hamburgs and Berlins. In honor of Baron von Steuben, the Prussian officer who aided our revolution, we have cities and towns in a number of States named after him. But I hope you'll forgive us, over the years we've sort of anglicized the pronunciation. We call them now Steubens and Steubensvilles. And the list goes on from Heidelberg, Mississippi, to Stuttgart, Arkansas.

But the Federal Republic of Germany and the United States of America share more than a common background and a well-established friendship. We share values about the importance of liberty. This year marks the 20th anniversary of the Berlin Wall, a border of brutality that assaults the human spirit and the civilized mind. On one side of the wall, people live in dignity and democracy; on the other side, in domination and defeat. We of the United States are aware of the relentless pressure on the Federal Republic and her citizens, and we admire you for your courage in the face of such grim realities.

The Federal Republic is perched on the cliff of freedom that overlooks Soviet dependents to the East. While the dominated peoples in these lands cannot enjoy your liberties, they can look at your example and hope. The United States is proud to stand beside you as your beacon shines brightly from that cliff of freedom.

We both recognize the challenges posed to our security by those who do not share our beliefs and our objectives. And together, we will act to counter those dangers. The United States will work in partnership with you and with our other European allies to bolster NATO and to offset the disturbing buildup of Soviet military forces. At the same time, we will work toward meaningful negotiations to limit those very weapons.

Mr. Chancellor, under your thoughtful and responsible leadership, the Federal Republic has sought to ease tensions in a world taut and quivering with the strains instability—not only between East and West but between North and South. And aware of the Federal Republic's other contributions as well. Americans remember that when the United States sought support in freeing American prisoners in Iran, the Federal Republic stood firmly by us, and we thank you for that support.

Although the Federal Republic, like the United States, is not immune to economic difficulties, the Communist countries cannot help but compare your well-being to their own shortages and hardships.

Our economic policies should be as closely allied as our defense policies, for in the end, our military capabilities are dependent on the strengths of our economies. Sound fiscal management was the hallmark of the Federal Republic's economic miracle, and we in the United States intend to import some of that responsibility to gain control of our own economy.

Chancellor Schmidt, I began these remarks speaking of German immigrants who came to America. Let me mention one immigrant in particular—Johann Augustus Roebling, the man who built the Brooklyn Bridge, which at its opening in 1883 was called the eighth wonder of the world. Well, Mr. Roebling spanned more than the East River with his accomplishment; he spanned two countries and two peoples. The discussions we have today will span our common goals and bridge our joint concerns. They will set the scene for the closest possible consultations in the future.

We have come to rely on one another in times of calm and in times of crisis, and that certainly is the basis of a true friend-partnership. It is in that spirit that I look forward to the important talks ahead.

And again, herzlich willkommen [a hearty welcome].

The Chancellor. Mr. President, Mrs. Reagan, ladies and gentlemen:

Thank you very much, Mr. President, for your cordial reception and your most friendly words of welcome.

This is not the first time I've been here, but on each occasion I'm impressed by the authority and dignity which radiates from this seat of government of the mighty United States of America. I am very glad to have this opportunity for an exchange of views with you, Mr. President, on major issues which both of us have much on our minds.

I cannot tell you how happy I am to know that you have recovered so well from the treacherous attempt on your life on the 30th of March. We in Germany have followed your rapid progress with much feeling, sir, and with a great sense of relief.

My visit to Washington is taking place against the background of a serious international situation. At the beginning of the eighties, we are confronted with a whole range of problems and challenges. I need only mention the excessive Soviet arms buildup, the challenge toward the community of nations resulting from the continuing Soviet intervention in Afghanistan, the threat to the non-alignment of the Third World countries stemming from unresolved political conflicts and as a result of East-West conflicts being transferred to their part of the world. And I need only mention, also, the impact of the oil price explosion on the whole world economy.

The Western democracies will be able to cope with these challenges if they show their determination, if they do take joint action, and if they let themselves be guided by the principles of consistency, predictability, and reliability.

Three weeks ago in Rome, Italy, our Alliance gave a clear signal for the continuity of our common policies. I regarded this as a proof of the Alliance's political strength. And as I said in the German Parliament 2 weeks ago, I also regard it as a success for your new administration, sir, here in Washington, D.C.

German-American partnership is today again manifest in the wide-ranging consultations between you, Mr. President, and the German head of government. Good and reliable relations between the Federal Republic of Germany and the United States of America are, in my view, a major factor for the security of the West and for international stability. I am confident that this visit will help us to fulfill our common responsibilities.

Thank you very much."
10203,"Rüdiger von Wechmar, PGA Closing Speech",http://undocs.org/en/A/36/PV.1,Rüdiger von Wechmar,President of the General Assembly,Inauguration Speech,1980,,"3. The TEMPORARY PRESIDENT: As Temporary President, may I be pennitted, by custom and tradition, for the last time to ask for your patience in order to share a few thoughts about our work and about the United Nations. 4. The thirty-fifth session has been a very hard-working Assembly. It had the longest agenda of any Assembly session to date. It had the greatest number of speakers ever to participate in the general debate last fall. It saw more Heads of State or Government and Foreign Minis- . ters coming to United Nations Headquarters than ever before. 5. My most sincere expression of gratitude once again goes to the delegations of aH 154 Member States for having honoured my country and myself by unanimously electing me President for the past year. 6. I also want to thank you all for the spirit of co-operation which you have shown on so many occasions and which has made my difficult task much easier. 7. My special thanks go to the Secretary-General and to his dedicated staff, without whom I would have failed in my duties from the very first day. 8. Our thirty-fifth seSsion of the General Assembly has, unfortunately, also been an Assembly of frustrations: frustrations mainly for the nations of the third world, but also, I am sure, for many of the industrialized countries. 9. The United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, the problem of Namibia, the launching of global ne- gotiations, the questions of Afghanistan and Kampuchea, the multifaceted problem of the Middle East and many, many others remain either unsolved or deadlocked. 10. In some areas the world appears to be heading towards a collision course. That is why I am deeply disturbed and why I would like to appeal urgently. to all Governments to give tangible proof dllring this thirtysixth session of the General Assembly of their detennination to preserve peace and security. 11. We must. not transfer tensions between East mId West to the third world. We must, on·the contrary, pre- serve the spirit and the concrete achievements of detente. A lessening of tension between the armed camps in East and West not only would be beneficial for all nations in Europe but would be of invaluable importance for the developing countries. 
l2':' ""\V~re and more resources without making the world more secUre. This year, nearly $500 billion are earmarked' for sophisticated weapons and military hardware. Measured in ~und~ pe~ person, there exists more explosive power on 'out'ptanetthan food. 13. ft.::n~ increase in. officjal development assistance eq~ivlllentJoonly 5.pe(cent Ofthat $Soo billion figure would 'be sufficient easily to attain the target set in the International Development Strategy for the Third United Na.tions Development Decade to ~elp those millions of hUrillPi 'beings who still live in want and poverty. 14~ The special session on disannament next year will offer new opportunities to set attainable targets and to conduct negotiations so as to build up a momentum for the, conclusion ofr..substantive agreements to halt and, indeed; to reverse me arms race. IS. Let us assist the most powerful, the United States and the Sovi~tUnion; to return to the negotiating table. I share the hope of so many among us that we may witness here at United Nations· Headquarters a resumption of negotiations between Washington and Moscow on the burning question of how to limit armaments, especially in the field of strategic nuclear weapons. A ;summit meeting soon of the Heads of State of the Soviet Union and the United States would; in my view, reinforce our quest for peace. 16. A face-te-face round of serious talks between those who.hold the ultimate key to peace in the world would undoubtedly hfllp to. remove the threat of the thunder. of guns. While I am fully aware of the need to avoid exaggermedexpectations from such a summit encounter, I believe .the magnitude of the danger posed by nuclear war requires recourse to the highest level. ' 17. ,1.fully understand that, without. tangible ~sults in negoti~tions, on balanced reductions. of arms, each side strives'to match,the other's increase .in deployed weapons. The !!ecurity' of the nations in Europe .seems to demand such protection. It must therefore be a prime duty of the United Nations to break this vicious circle. 18. the tinchaflengedinternational arms traffic andthe continqed danger()f military conflicts by proxy constitute additional threats'to peace and security. The United Nations must; therefore; not only devote much of its energy and time to the creation of confidence-building measures and' to concrete .steps'towards' disarmament,but must also renew its efforts· to. establish a mOre effective United Nations peace-keeping machinery. Our Charter contains sufficient provisions to increase the present limited United Nations role. 19. One important part of peace-keeping, in a wider and non-military sense, would be the orderly and agreed restructuring of 'iilternational economic relations through global negotiations. I reported to the Assembly at length onthlrt SUbject during the closing meeting of. the·thirtyfifty session yesterday.' ; 20. I would fail in my duties, however;'were fnotto address today an urgent and very sincere appeal to the Government of the United States to complete its eight month-long review of this vital iSSUe in the very near future and to return to consultations and the negotiating table soon after the meeting of 22 Heads of State or 'Government from North and South, which will be held at Cancun next month. 21. I am confident that the United States, in its review of the world economy, will not overlook the mutual political benefits which a stable world economic system will have for peaceful co-operation among nations on the basis of equal partnership. 22. I fully share the view of the Prime Minister of Australia, Mr. Malcolm Fraser, who recently stated that we should all accept and take seriously and sincerely the reality of the South or the Third World as a political presence on the world stage. Changes' in international institutions and processes were inevitable, he said. He stressed that the question was whether those changes were to be orderly, negotiated ones or imposed by disruption and breakdown. 23. Let me add this. At times when it appears necessary to have a strong lobby in certain capitals of the world for major problems facing us all, it is deplorable that there are so few in some important countries to lobby for the Third World poor. Let this Assembly, therefore, remain the prime mover of solutions for the plight of the many millions of people who do not share in the benefits of the modem world. 24. During my tenure as President of the thirty-fifth session of the General Assembly, 'I have been privileged to see at first hand the remarkably effective and valuable work of the United Nations programmes and specialized agencies in many parts of the world. Let m~ testify here today that all of them do an outstanding job in their specific field of competence. But let me-pars pro to1Opay special tribute to one of them: the United Nations Development Programme [UNDP]. This organization, drawing on three decades of experience and the specialized technical expertise of the entire United Nations system, is making a dramatic and indispensable contribution to the development efforts of the countries it serves. 2S. Less than two months ago, the Economic and Social Council in its resolution 19811S9 reaffirmed ""the central funding and co-ordinating role of the United Nations Development Programme in the field of technical co-operation"". Yet at this moment, because of the failure of the international community to meet the planning target of voluntary contributions which this Assembly itself has approved [resolution 35/83], a failure compounded by unpredictable fluctuations in currency exchange rates, the resource base of UNDP, upon which its critically important work for the next five years depends, is uncertain, to say the least. 26. Governments-all Governments-have a serious responsibility to provide this proven institution, which they themselves have created, with the resources it must have if the international development effort is not to falter. I therefore urgently appeal to all Governments to increase their contributions to this unique mechanism of international co-operation, as well as to other United Nations programmes and agencies, all of which are suffering setbacks because of fluctuating currency exchange rates.
27. As the momentum towards a truly effective NorthSouth dialogue intensifies, it would be ironic-indeed, tragic-if the vitality of one of the most effective instruments for North-South co-operation which the international community has ever created were threatened Rlld ~roded. 28. In connexion with the necessary support for the United Nation!: specialized agenries I would like to raise another point. During my seven years as representative of my country, I have had the privilege of being invited to many social functions held by colleagues or delegations. Often when I was myself the host 1 wondered, though, whether som!.' of that money was always well spent, when one thinks ef those many, many people-especially children-suffering from hunger and disease. 2~ . Did you know that one single dollar given to liNICEF instead would be enough to provide vaccine to immunize 50 children against tuberculosis? Are we aware that $500 would buy a kit of equipment and medicines for a village pharmacy, and that $3,500, a fraction of the cost of a major reception, wouid purchase the equipment for a main health centre-often serving an area with as many as 100,000 people-including basic clinical, surgical and diagnostic instruments and vital drugs? 30. Maybe we could start a competition among Member States willing to designate at least part of their funds for social functions to UNICEF or any other humanitarian United Nations programme, such as that of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. The Acting President will begin by making such a donation himself. 3!. Allow me now to reflect specially on the work of our Assembly. While I look back with pride and gratitude, I must ted you-after 12 '""Ilonths of very specific experience-that there is room f"", r far-reaching improvement. There is reason in some fields for concern, and even for complaint. 32. Our General Assembly-indeed, our United Nations-is being slowly suffocated by too many resolutions, too many meetings, too many subsidiary organs, far too much documentation. In short, the United Nations disease of elephantiasis must be attacked with strong sur- gical therapy to remove the patient speedily from the critical list. 33. Let me give you a few concrete examples to illustrate what I have in mind. 34. The total number of hours spent by the United Nations in meetings during 1980, both here at headquarters and in Geneva, was equivalent to 1,170 full days. Last year, the plenary session of the General Assembly and its main committees lost 168 hours of meeting time-·or one full week-simply through late starting. 35. During the September to December period of the thirty-fifth session of the General Assembly a total of some 236 million pages of documentation was printed at United Nations Headquarters. Laid end to end this would cover 33,000 kilometres, or four-fifths of the equator. All the documents produced in 1980 in New York and Gen- eva almost reached the I billion mark, anct..Iaid end to end would cover 270,000 kilometres. The prOduction of two years would easily pave our way to themaoil. 
36. Summary records were produced·for 354 meetings of the thirty-fifth session of the General Assembly. These records required 4,602 staff-days, the average cost of a record for one meeting was cn the order of $3,648. One page of summary record costs more than the annual per capita incoP'l~ in any of the least developed countries. 37. I do not want to be misunderstood. When I expose some of the defects of our work, I do this because I am a compassionate and dedicated believer in the United Nations. I know full well that I am furnishing fresh ammunition to cheap critics of our Organization. But they will go on criticizing in My .:ase. What I seek is change. We are responsible for this disease ourselves. .{ want the United Nations to be strengthened. To be strong we have to be effective. To be effective we must drastically cut out the fat and fows on priorities. How can we attempt to man- age crises in this world if we seem unable to manage our own affairs? We should take a fresh look now at where fat could be cut out, where activities could be streamlined and how the daily avalanche of paper, which I am sure it must be a horrendous task for delegations to cope with- can be reduced to a bare-and I mean ""ba.--e""-mini- mum. Strict austerity appears to be required so that we do not drown ill a self-created sea of paper. 38. I recognize that over the past few years we have made some progress in rationalizing the work of our Assembly. Thanks to very constructive and fruitful c:ollaboration between delegat~ons and the Secretariat, a num~r of modest refonns have been introduced. Nevertheless, it is quite apparent to all of us that, with.the continued in- crease in membership, the further growth and the size of our agenda and the inflation in documentation, a great deal remains to be done. 39. Let me make a concrete proposal. In considering how we might most successfully Come to grips with these problems on a continuing basis, I suggest that there be an l'lIInual meeting of the five most'recent Presidents of the General Assembly, who would represent each geographical region. The purpose would·be that those who have pre&ided over thtl work of this body would·examine cur- rent procedures in the light of their experience, with a view to making recommendations for further improvements. This ""Council of Presidents"" should close!y co- operate with the Secretary-General of our Organization. It does seem to me unfortunate that up to this time there has been no consistent way to draw upon the experience of fonner presiding officers when we·review, as we should do continually, how our legislative performance might be improved. This proposal provides a relatively easy way to remedy that deficiency. 40. The Assemb!y might also wish lo consider requesting that this council of five Presidents suggest other meas- ures that they .believe could invigorate the work of this institution. There are, of GOUiSe, numerous groups of ex- perts whose studies and recommendations are made available to the· United Nations. However, there·is.no systematic way in whkh the expertise of those individuals who have had the invaluable personal experience of presiding over the Assembly·can be brought into focus and shared with the membership. 41. Another concern which I would like to share with members is the noli-implementation of General Assembly resolutions. We have seen an improvement in the number of resolutions adopted without a vote-that is, by consen- sus. It has drastically increased during the last 10 years from 35 per cent to 59 ~r cent, but it is noteworthy that some Member States fad to implement fully even those resolutions for which they themselves have voted. 42. It is easy to blame the United Nations as an institution for such failures. It would be more appropriate, I think, .0 address criticism of the United Nations to the Governments of Member States instead. What the world is expec!ing from its leaders, especially from those at the helm of the most powerful Member States, is vision and compassion, determination and dedication. We have been talking so much and so often of the need for political will. The time to act and to show such political will is now; tomorrow may be too late. 43. Permit me to close my remarks with a verse by an eighteenth.cent9,ry theologist, a prayer which I hope will guide us during the thirty-sixth session of the General Assembly:
""God grant us the serenity to accept things we can- not change, the courage to change the things we can, and the wisdom to know the difference between the two.""

10204,"Ronald Raegan, Presidential Inauguration Speech",https://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/reagan1.asp,Ronald Raegan,President (United States),Inauguration Speech,1981,,"Senator Hatfield, Mr. Chief Justice, Mr. President, Vice President Bush, Vice President Mondale, Senator Baker, Speaker O'Neill, Reverend Moomaw, and my fellow citizens: To a few of us here today, this is a solemn and most momentous occasion; and yet, in the history of our Nation, it is a commonplace occurrence. The orderly transfer of authority as called for in the Constitution routinely takes place as it has for almost two centuries and few of us stop to think how unique we really are. In the eyes of many in the world, this every-4-year ceremony we accept as normal is nothing less than a miracle.

Mr. President, I want our fellow citizens to know how much you did to carry on this tradition. By your gracious cooperation in the transition process, you have shown a watching world that we are a united people pledged to maintaining a political system which guarantees individual liberty to a greater degree than any other, and I thank you and your people for all your help in maintaining the continuity which is the bulwark of our Republic.

The business of our nation goes forward. These United States are confronted with an economic affliction of great proportions. We suffer from the longest and one of the worst sustained inflations in our national history. It distorts our economic decisions, penalizes thrift, and crushes the struggling young and the fixed- income elderly alike. It threatens to shatter the lives of millions of our people.

Idle industries have cast workers into unemployment, causing human misery and personal indignity. Those who do work are denied a fair return for their labor by a tax system which penalizes successful achievement and keeps us from maintaining full productivity.

But great as our tax burden is, it has not kept pace with public spending. For decades, we have piled deficit upon deficit, mortgaging our future and our children's future for the temporary convenience of the present. To continue this long trend is to guarantee tremendous social, cultural, political, and economic upheavals.

You and I, as individuals, can, by borrowing, live beyond our means, but for only a limited period of time. Why, then, should we think that collectively, as a nation, we are not bound by that same limitation?

We must act today in order to preserve tomorrow. And let there be no misunderstanding--we are going to begin to act, beginning today.

The economic ills we suffer have come upon us over several decades. They will not go away in days, weeks, or months, but they will go away. They will go away because we, as Americans, have the capacity now, as we have had in the past, to do whatever needs to be done to preserve this last and greatest bastion of freedom.

In this present crisis, government is not the solution to our problem; government is the problem.

From time to time, we have been tempted to believe that society has become too complex to be managed by self-rule, that government by an elite group is superior to government for, by, and of the people. But if no one among us is capable of governing himself, then who among us has the capacity to govern someone else? All of us together, in and out of government, must bear the burden. The solutions we seek must be equitable, with no one group singled out to pay a higher price.

We hear much of special interest groups. Our concern must be for a special interest group that has been too long neglected. It knows no sectional boundaries or ethnic and racial divisions, and it crosses political party lines. It is made up of men and women who raise our food, patrol our streets, man our mines and our factories, teach our children, keep our homes, and heal us when we are sick--professionals, industrialists, shopkeepers, clerks, cabbies, and truckdrivers. They are, in short, ""We the people,"" this breed called Americans.

Well, this administration's objective will be a healthy, vigorous, growing economy that provides equal opportunity for all Americans, with no barriers born of bigotry or discrimination. Putting America back to work means putting all Americans back to work. Ending inflation means freeing all Americans from the terror of runaway living costs. All must share in the productive work of this ""new beginning"" and all must share in the bounty of a revived economy. With the idealism and fair play which are the core of our system and our strength, we can have a strong and prosperous America at peace with itself and the world.

So, as we begin, let us take inventory. We are a nation that has a government--not the other way around. And this makes us special among the nations of the Earth. Our Government has no power except that granted it by the people. It is time to check and reverse the growth of government which shows signs of having grown beyond the consent of the governed.

It is my intention to curb the size and influence of the Federal establishment and to demand recognition of the distinction between the powers granted to the Federal Government and those reserved to the States or to the people. All of us need to be reminded that the Federal Government did not create the States; the States created the Federal Government.

Now, so there will be no misunderstanding, it is not my intention to do away with government. It is, rather, to make it work-work with us, not over us; to stand by our side, not ride on our back. Government can and must provide opportunity, not smother it; foster productivity, not stifle it.

If we look to the answer as to why, for so many years, we achieved so much, prospered as no other people on Earth, it was because here, in this land, we unleashed the energy and individual genius of man to a greater extent than has ever been done before. Freedom and the dignity of the individual have been more available and assured here than in any other place on Earth. The price for this freedom at times has been high, but we have never been unwilling to pay that price.

It is no coincidence that our present troubles parallel and are proportionate to the intervention and intrusion in our lives that result from unnecessary and excessive growth of government. It is time for us to realize that we are too great a nation to limit ourselves to small dreams. We are not, as some would have us believe, loomed to an inevitable decline. I do not believe in a fate that will all on us no matter what we do. I do believe in a fate that will fall on us if we do nothing. So, with all the creative energy at our command, let us begin an era of national renewal. Let us renew our determination, our courage, and our strength. And let us renew; our faith and our hope.

We have every right to dream heroic dreams. Those who say that we are in a time when there are no heroes just don't know where to look. You can see heroes every day going in and out of factory gates. Others, a handful in number, produce enough food to feed all of us and then the world beyond. You meet heroes across a counter--and they are on both sides of that counter. There are entrepreneurs with faith in themselves and faith in an idea who create new jobs, new wealth and opportunity. They are individuals and families whose taxes support the Government and whose voluntary gifts support church, charity, culture, art, and education. Their patriotism is quiet but deep. Their values sustain our national life.

I have used the words ""they"" and ""their"" in speaking of these heroes. I could say ""you"" and ""your"" because I am addressing the heroes of whom I speak--you, the citizens of this blessed land. Your dreams, your hopes, your goals are going to be the dreams, the hopes, and the goals of this administration, so help me God.

We shall reflect the compassion that is so much a part of your makeup. How can we love our country and not love our countrymen, and loving them, reach out a hand when they fall, heal them when they are sick, and provide opportunities to make them self- sufficient so they will be equal in fact and not just in theory?

Can we solve the problems confronting us? Well, the answer is an unequivocal and emphatic ""yes."" To paraphrase Winston Churchill, I did not take the oath I have just taken with the intention of presiding over the dissolution of the world's strongest economy.

In the days ahead I will propose removing the roadblocks that have slowed our economy and reduced productivity. Steps will be taken aimed at restoring the balance between the various levels of government. Progress may be slow--measured in inches and feet, not miles--but we will progress. Is it time to reawaken this industrial giant, to get government back within its means, and to lighten our punitive tax burden. And these will be our first priorities, and on these principles, there will be no compromise.

On the eve of our struggle for independence a man who might have been one of the greatest among the Founding Fathers, Dr. Joseph Warren, President of the Massachusetts Congress, said to his fellow Americans, ""Our country is in danger, but not to be despaired of.... On you depend the fortunes of America. You are to decide the important questions upon which rests the happiness and the liberty of millions yet unborn. Act worthy of yourselves.""

Well, I believe we, the Americans of today, are ready to act worthy of ourselves, ready to do what must be done to ensure happiness and liberty for ourselves, our children and our children's children.

And as we renew ourselves here in our own land, we will be seen as having greater strength throughout the world. We will again be the exemplar of freedom and a beacon of hope for those who do not now have freedom.

To those neighbors and allies who share our freedom, we will strengthen our historic ties and assure them of our support and firm commitment. We will match loyalty with loyalty. We will strive for mutually beneficial relations. We will not use our friendship to impose on their sovereignty, for or own sovereignty is not for sale.

As for the enemies of freedom, those who are potential adversaries, they will be reminded that peace is the highest aspiration of the American people. We will negotiate for it, sacrifice for it; we will not surrender for it--now or ever.

Our forbearance should never be misunderstood. Our reluctance for conflict should not be misjudged as a failure of will. When action is required to preserve our national security, we will act. We will maintain sufficient strength to prevail if need be, knowing that if we do so we have the best chance of never having to use that strength.

Above all, we must realize that no arsenal, or no weapon in the arsenals of the world, is so formidable as the will and moral courage of free men and women. It is a weapon our adversaries in today's world do not have. It is a weapon that we as Americans do have. Let that be understood by those who practice terrorism and prey upon their neighbors.

I am told that tens of thousands of prayer meetings are being held on this day, and for that I am deeply grateful. We are a nation under God, and I believe God intended for us to be free. It would be fitting and good, I think, if on each Inauguration Day in future years it should be declared a day of prayer.

This is the first time in history that this ceremony has been held, as you have been told, on this West Front of the Capitol. Standing here, one faces a magnificent vista, opening up on this city's special beauty and history. At the end of this open mall are those shrines to the giants on whose shoulders we stand.

Directly in front of me, the monument to a monumental man: George Washington, Father of our country. A man of humility who came to greatness reluctantly. He led America out of revolutionary victory into infant nationhood. Off to one side, the stately memorial to Thomas Jefferson. The Declaration of Independence flames with his eloquence.

And then beyond the Reflecting Pool the dignified columns of the Lincoln Memorial. Whoever would understand in his heart the meaning of America will find it in the life of Abraham Lincoln.

Beyond those monuments to heroism is the Potomac River, and on the far shore the sloping hills of Arlington National Cemetery with its row on row of simple white markers bearing crosses or Stars of David. They add up to only a tiny fraction of the price that has been paid for our freedom.

Each one of those markers is a monument to the kinds of hero I spoke of earlier. Their lives ended in places called Belleau Wood, The Argonne, Omaha Beach, Salerno and halfway around the world on Guadalcanal, Tarawa, Pork Chop Hill, the Chosin Reservoir, and in a hundred rice paddies and jungles of a place called Vietnam.

Under one such marker lies a young man--Martin Treptow--who left his job in a small town barber shop in 1917 to go to France with the famed Rainbow Division. There, on the western front, he was killed trying to carry a message between battalions under heavy artillery fire.

We are told that on his body was found a diary. On the flyleaf under the heading, ""My Pledge,"" he had written these words: ""America must win this war. Therefore, I will work, I will save, I will sacrifice, I will endure, I will fight cheerfully and do my utmost, as if the issue of the whole struggle depended on me alone.""

The crisis we are facing today does not require of us the kind of sacrifice that Martin Treptow and so many thousands of others were called upon to make. It does require, however, our best effort, and our willingness to believe in ourselves and to believe in our capacity to perform great deeds; to believe that together, with God's help, we can and will resolve the problems which now confront us.

And, after all, why shouldn't we believe that? We are Americans. God bless you, and thank you."
10211,"Ismat T. Kittani, PGA Closing Speech",http://undocs.org/en/A/36/PV.111,Ismat T. Kittani,President of the General Assembly,Inauguration Speech,1981,,"50. The PRESIDENT: We are now coming to the end of the thirty-sixth session of the General Assembly. The ending of an Assembly session and the beginning of another is, like the coming of a new year, a time for reflection and assessment. It is difficult to look back on the last year without recalling the many frustrations we have experienced, the many tangible and sorely needed accomplishments that have eluded us. 51. It is a sad commentary on the state of international affairs that during the past year one of the few sources of satisfaction has been the fact that·we have not used nuclear weapons in combat. However, nuclear weapons are about theonly weapons that have not been used-on both military and civilian targets-during this unhappy period. Our inability to manage affairs among nations is self-evident; as we sit here, just one day before the first International Day of Peace designated by the General Assembly, there is armed conflict in virtually all areas of the planet. 52. Nothing was more frustrating during my tenure as President than the disappointing results of the second special session of the Assembly devoted to disarmament-all the more so because during topse days in June and July the eyes ef the world were upon us and the hopes and fears of millions of people were centred in this great Hall. We failed to meet the challenge, but we must not regard this failure as final. There is no area more important to the future of humanity~and civilization than disarmament. In spite of the frustrations and disappointments we must not relent in our efforts to make progress towards this most essential goal. 53. At the thirty-sixth session, as well as at three resumed sessions of the seventh emergency special session, another a..""'ea with which the Assembly has been extensively concerned is the Middle East and the core of the conflict there, the question of Palestine. Perhaps in no area have there been more resolutions-adopted not only by the Assembly but also by the Security Councilwhich hCive been ignored. The continuing agony in Lebanon and the most recent inhuman tragic massacres in Beirut are but the most chilling demonstration of what happens when resolutions adopted by overwhelming majorities are ignored and, instead, the tragic path of war and destruction is followed. 54. This makes all too real a point which I have made to you more than once but which I feel must be reiterated today. Our problem is not the absence of adequate resolutions as much as the need to seek new and better ways to obtain compliance with those resolutions already adopted-quite often unanimously or by consensus. Nowhere is this chasm oetween word and deed deeper than in the Middle East.
55. The Secretary-General has with candour and courage spoken directly to this point in his report on the work of the Organization [A/36/l]. It is 'essential to the future of this institution-and to the future of humanity-that the Member States address seriously the concerns he has raised.
56. We face today a gmwing decline in the use and effectiveness of multilateral institutions so laboriously developed after the Second World War and a corresponding increase in reliance on bilateral and unilateral actions. The importance and authority of multilateral forums, both regional a~d worldwide, is too frequently ignored by Gov- ernme~ts, bent as they are on gaining short-term, often short-sighted, advantages rather than working to build enduring peace. The willingness of Governments to endeavour within these .insututions first to define and then to work towards achieving common goals and collective security is in serious de6;line.
57. I submit to you toriay, as we conclude this thirtysixth session of the Genetal Assembly, that to arrest and rev~rse thi~ decline is th~ most serious task facing the ~mted Nations and other Intergovernmental organizations In the months and years ahead. If the worldwide revulsion and indignation generated by the unspeakable crImes commi~ed in Beirut .can be directed .effectively towards ~e ~chl~vement of ~IS ta~k. perhaps the innocent civilian victims In west Beirut wIll not have died in vain.
58. In the course of the history of the planet and the evolution of civilized mankind, 36 years is only a brief m01!lent. The United ~ations has accomplished much agam~t gre~t odds, dunng these years. Our frustrations and dlsappomtments at our shortcomings should not make us forget- our real and important achievements. The Convention on the Law of the Sea is a tribute to what can be achieved through the process of multinational diplomacy. We must never forget that the United Nations affords us the necessary means; but it remains for Member States to supply the political will and determination to utilize it eff~ctively in t~e common interest. There is simply no ratIOnal alternative and no room for despondency or despair.
59. I had, to be sure, anticipated that my year as President of the General Assembly would be a most interesting and challenging experience, beginning with the rather dramatic circumstances of my election. However, despite my many years of association with the United Nations, I had not realized how enjoyable and exciting-even exhilarating-this. experience would be. Throughout the year, the co-operation I have received from delega:ions of Member S~tes has been exem~lary, for which I am in your debt. ThiS, f!1ore than anythmg, has made the past year a richly rewardmg one.

I, The PRESIDENT: The General Assembly has before it a letter dated 11 December 1981 from the President of the Security Council to the President of the General Assembly [A/36/820]. It reads as follows: 
""I have the honour to inform you that the Security Council, at its 2312th meeting, held in private on I1 December 1981, unanimously adopted resolution 494 (198 i) concerning the appointment of the SecretaryGeneral of the United Nations. The resolution reads as follows:
"" 'The Security Council,
""'Having considered the q~estion recommendation for the appomtment Secretary-General of the United Nations,
'"" Recommends to the General Assembly that Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar be appointed SecretaryGeneral of the United Nations for a term of office from I January 1982 to 31 December 1986' …
In connection with this recommendation of the Security Council, the General Assembly has before it a draft resolution in document A/36/L.56, the only document before the Assembly on which action is required.
In view of the unanimous recommendation of the Security Council and in the light of the wish expressed by many delegations. may I take it that it is the desire of the General Assembly to adopt draft resolution A/36/L.56 by acclamation?
The draft resollltion was adopted by acclamation (resoIlItion 36/137).
4. The PRESIDENT: I have the honour to' announce that Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar has been appointed by acclamation Secretary-General of the United Nations for a term of office beginning I January 1982 and ending on 31 December 19860
The President of the Security Council, the President of the Economic and Social Council, the President of the Trusteeship Council. the Vice-President (do the General Assembly and thi/ Chairmen of the Main Committees took places on the platform.
Mr. Aly /. Teymour, Chief of Protocol, conducted Mr. Perez de Cue"",:r to the platform.
The PRESIDENT: I have the honour to inform Mr. Perez de Cuellar officially that the General Assembly' has appointed him Secretary-General of the United Nations for a term of office beginning I January 1982 and ending on 31 December 1986
I ask Mr. Perez de Cuellar to repeat after me the oath of office.
Mr. PEREZ DE CUELLAR: I, Javier Perez de' Cuellar, solemnly swear to exercise in all loyalty, discretion and conscience the functions entrusted to me as Secretary-General of the United Nations, to discharge these functions and regulate my conduct with the interests of the United Nations only in view, and not to seek or accept instructions in regard to the performance of my duties from any Government or other authority external to the Organization.
The PRESIDENT: I am certain that on this occasion I speak for every member of the General Assembly in extending our sincere congratulations to the Secretary-General-elect. We welcome him most warmly. and we pledge him our full co-operation and support. We wish him a very fruitful term of office and extend all our best wishes to him in his future endeavours in the interests of the international community. May the United Nations. under his leadership, move further forward in becoming the centre for harmonizing actions as foreseen in the Charter
I now invite Mr. Perez de Cueliar to make a statement
Mr. PEREZ DE CUELLAR (interpretation from Spanish): Mr. President, I am greatly honoured and moved by your kind and generous words of welcome.
The trust and confidence placed in me fills me with deep gratitude and humility. I am profoundly grateful to the President and the members of the Security Council for recommending my appointment and to the General Assembly for accepting the recommendation by acclamation. I stand here before ihe entire membership of the United Nations. mindful that the support it has given me is an expression of its solidarity. This is and will be my ultimate source of strength. I fully realize that the task that has been entrusted to me is unique in its nature, complexity and magnitude. I pledge to you my utmost dedication and impartiality in discharging the responsibilities deriving' from that task.
I am also aware that my appointment indicates recognition of the important role being played by Africa, Asia and Latin America in our collective struggle to realize the aims and purposes laid down in the Charter of the United Nations. I believe that, in consequence of the near universalityl'lf representation achieved' by the Organization. one of the essential conditions for strengthening the foundations of peace, justice and progress throughout the world is a practical awareness of the vital aspirations of the majority of mankind consistent with the requirements of stability and balance.
This is not an election campaign 'speech, as I have already been elected. Hence, I do not propose to offer a programme or to make promises. This would not be appropriate to the nature of the function that I am going to fulfil. The General Assembly, whose session is drawing to a close, has reviewed the major issues for which the Organization has responsibility: disarmament; social and economic matters, including human rights; the vestiges of colonialism, and the development of international law, among others. As an important part of my service to the Organization, I shall assist in the implementation of the Assembly's decisions in these fields.
I am aware-and the ever-vigilant international press has made it its business to keep us mindful of the fact-that we are going through a period of intense and renewed criticism of the United Nations.
The Secretary-General is usually an easy target for such criticism, which sometimes can be attributed to other bodies in the United Nations. They have had to be faced by the four Secretaries-General, but perhaps now they are more intensive because of the renewed international tension, a growing feeling of frustration among the developing countries and the proportionate disappointment on the part of the world public. We may also glimpse a sort of groundswell which could almost be described as revisionist.
I shall resist the temptation to answer those cntlcisms with the platitude that the United Nations is merely a reflection of the political will and actions of the States Members. As its name indicates and as is apparent from the Charter, the United Nations is a body of States gathered together for purposes and ends which go beyond and above purely national motives. Hence this house symbolizes an entity that is conceptually different from the component parts. It is almost possible to say. paraphrasing Darwin, that. being a more complex entity, the Organization is a more advanced evolutionary form, since it represents a kind of community life that is higher than what would prevail if it did not exist.
For these reasons, I think that the United Nations does not need to apologize for the fact that it is in the forefront and for possessing this element of futurism which of necessity must appear in its activities. There will always be someone to tell us that we are an idea whose time has not yet come, but we have to ann ourselves not only with courage but also with the feeling of reality which is necessary so as not to be overcome by discouragement. like the mythological character who was for ever pushing a rock uphill.
I must say that I do have a clear and at the same time a sober and positive idea of the responsibilities given to me by the General Assembly's decision. In the past 10 years I have been almost constantly linked to the Organization. A good part of those years I have spent exclusively in the Organization's service. I have been able to get the feeling of its political dramas, both in the Security Council. where I had to preside at difficult times, and in the Secretariat. on delicate missions in various countries. I have had the opportunity also, as Chairman of the Group of 77, to participate' fully in the frustrating endeavours to bring about a new international economic order. I have seen for myself, as an international official, the requirements of the Organization's staff. 19. I was trained in law, and therefore I am aware that the Secretary-General is at the service of the international community and specifically of this Organization. I know that he does not have a supranational function, but an inherent part of the responsibility of the Secretary-General to the community-and the practical consequence of the existence of a body such as this-is that he become the advocate of the causes of common interest. No one is more clearly above national or regional considerations. 20. The Secretary-General, in order to fulfil his responsibilities properly, must be able to rely on the understanding, the patience and the support of Member States, particularly when he has to adopt attitudes which may seem to run counter to their positions or short-tenn inclinations. His sole guiding star must be the promotion of. causes favourable to the progress of all, for the benefit of all, on the basis of international peace and security and Unswervingly directed towards justice, in confonnity with the mandate given him by the Charter. It is my firm purpose in this regard to reactivate the political role of the SecretaryGeneral within our constitutional parameters, always attentive to the very rapid development of events and takingcarenot to be dragged along by them. I clearly perceive the importance of the trust that has been placed in me by all Members of the Organization, and it is my intention to make use of it by consultation and in the interest of consensus, because these constitute the very essence of our common task.
I am assuming the post of Secretary-General at a time when, after a long period of delay, the long-standing initiative for the renewal of global negotiations between North and South is coming back within the purview of the United Nations. This coincides with one of the most serious world economic crises of the past few decades. the most sorely pressed victims of which are the populations of the developing countries. The social and political thrust of the crisis is axiomatic. In so far as the just and proper expectations. for so long unfulfilled, of thousands of millions of human beings are disappointed yet again. and at a time of political confrontation, the most fundamental human rights. particularly the right to a better distribution of wealth and social well-being. are in fact being infringed.
Despite the ecumenical nature of the task that I am going to assume as Secretary-General of all the United Nations. I am a Peruvian. and I cannot and must not separate myself from my origins in a developing countr~. and. furthermore, from the fact that I have represented It as a diplomat throughout almost my entire adult life. It has been my fortune to participate in the preparation and execution of the foreign policy of my country and of the third world many times. Therefore I am very much aware, of the need to provide an impetus to the renewal 01 global negotiations. and I wish to say now that. beyo.nd the contribution that the Secretariat can give in its admlOistrative and advisory functions. I will always be ready.'o give my personal co-operation. if that should prove deSIrable.
 could not hope to act fruitfully in any of the, areas to which I have alludyd ifI were not able to avail myself of one of the most capable and dedicated civil services in the world. I have witnessed its qualities personally. I am aware, however, that there may be a kind of revolution of rising expectations brewing. I wish to launch an appeal to those men and women, whom I admire and respect so much for their support, in order that we may turn the Secretariat once again into an active organization for peace and development,' an instrument ever less bureaucratic, ever more integrated and efficacious., The fact that greater responsibility goes hand in hand with an improvementin working conditions does not escape me; I trust that I can count on their understanding, co-operation and imagination in the search for satisfactory solutions to their problems, to the examination of which I propose to' give priority.
In order to galvanize the Secretariat and to integrate it more organically into the action of the United Nations as a whole, I need to count on the support of Member States. I am to head a Secretariat which must preserve its basic sense as an authentic international civil service so as gen_uinely to serve the interests of the international community. In accordance with the Charter, this necessarily entails strict independence with respect to the national interests of the States which are a part of the Organization. I fully trust the General Assembly, which lays down the rules for the appointment by the Secretary-General of Secretariat personnel, to provide me with tools required for the full discharge of my task-not for the purpose of promoting greater growth in the Secretariat than is necessary, but rather with the main purpose of making the present Secretariat ever more efficient, morally committed, as I hope it will feel, to the goals of the international community as reflected in the Charter. [The Secretary-General-elect continued ill French.]
I wish to assure you that my sole ambition is to serve the higher interests of the international community and to work for the realization of the ideals and aspirations of which the Organization is the repository and of which it must remain the symbol. 26. It is my conviction that the Organization must constantly represent the expression of the universal con- -science. To that end I shall do everything within my power to ensure that the purposes and principles of the Charter are scrupulously observed. I shall take up every problem or issue in an open-minded fashion and I shall act with awareness and according to conscience, on the basis of right, law and justice. [The Secretary-General-elect resumed in Spanish.] 27. I am sorry that I cannot speak Arabic, Chinese or Russian, which are admirable languages, and thus better express my thinking to the representatives who use those official working languages. 28. I do not wish to close this my first statement to the General Assembly as Secretary-General without paying a ,proper tribute to Mr. Kurt Waldheim, who on various occasions in the last decade, has done me the' honour of ,showing his confidence in me in many areas. His devotion to peace is deservedly on record for history. I wish as a close colleague and co-worker in the diplomatic service to bear witness to his outstanding skill as a negotiator and to his untiring tenacity in the service of the international community.
The noble oath that I have just taken before the Assembly as the consummate democratic body of the Organization might have exempted me from reading out this statement. Hence I wish to conclude by reiterating·that I shall carry out·that oath with loyalty, discretion and conscientiousness. ,

Chancellor Cole, I appreciated very much that magnificent gesture. I understand that in Bonn or some 75,000 people attended the rally one of the banners read say something good about America today is certainly makes all Americans happy to repay this compliment Mr. Chancellor about the German people at about the strong bond that unites us. A recent study has revealed that today more Americans trace their ancestry to your country, than any other Nation German immigrants provided the hard work and determination that said much of the Midwest taking rugged frontierland like that in the Dakotas and reaping from a Bountiful Harvest that help feed the world in other Industries German and standard of living and elevated a lot of the Common Man from a life of drudgery to new progress consistent with individual dignity and respect. As you are aware Mr. Chancellor, it wasn't simply hard work that built America it was Freedom available here, freedom to which German immigrants greatly contributed. One of the first president's for freedom of press for example was established when Peter Zenger a German immigrant spoke out in a newspaper against the abuse of power by a public official when they were laying freedom of press as a Cornerstone of our democratic system let me know what the 19th century on turmoil with sweeping through Western Europe we were the recipient of any political Exiles who made significant contributions to American Liberty Shultz, one of the most remarkable was one of the original members of the Republican Party, I can see one reason why I personally am so grateful to Chancellor with us today degree to is a group of young people from your country who are spending the Autumn months living with American families in Virginia are part of our youth exchange project, between our two countries this these kinds of ties bode well for the future, the future of both our Nations depend so much on friendship in the values we share in these uncertain times when I power to the east is building a massive war machine far in excess of any legitimate defensive Dave's the Western democracies must stand firmly together with our freedom and peace of the world are to be preserved. The German people around the frontlines of Freedom when I was in your country a few months ago I told you were citizens You Are Not Alone we are with you or today mr. Chancellor I can tell you that we are happy that the German people are with us the Western democracies the future freedom of mankind as a piece of the world would be far less secure if it were not so I will appreciate it here As is the depth what you add to the meaning of our covenant in truth is you recently observed we are not a military alliance. The community of arms you said he was there to defend the community of ideas the important point is that we have, and ideas regarding human rights civil rights are moral values our moral laws. I look forward to our talks today so I would expect at a meeting of the leaders of the two great Nations whose interests are so intertwined there are many vital issues to discuss as all good friends do we will disagree at times but in free societies we’re accustomed to differences and also to a peaceful resolution to achieve our common goals. As we stand here today, I am confident that our shared interests and our joint commitment to human freedom will overcome any differences between our countries are governments will work in the closest consultation in a spirit of spirit of Amity and straightforwardness we thank you for coming and the name of the people of the United States.
 
Mr. President, Mrs. Reagan, Ladies and gentlemen, I thank you Mr. president most warmly will the very kind words of Welcome and for the warm-hearted reception we've been getting here we have been given here.
On 7th April 1953,  Almost 30 years ago the chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany stood here for the first time and Konrad Adenauer said that we are loyal partners for freedom and peace a road on is ahead ahead of all other Nations. I want you and all citizens of the United States to know still hold true today and will do so in the future as well Germany is and will remain a loyal partner United States of America.
Recent opinion polls have shown once more, that in the Federal Republic of Germany there is wide based firm confidence in the Atlantic partnership. To all Americans therefore I say today most emphatically you can count on your German friends. If I had our friendship with the United States all the foundation of our active policy for safeguarding peace in Freedom. 
 
The North atlantic alliance and our friendship with the united states, are the foundation of our active policy for safeguarding peace and freedom.
The real strength of our alliance doesn’t derive solely from the number of troops and weapons. Our alliance is strong because the citizens of 16 North American and European countries have a common goal. They are determined to safeguard the freedom common heritage and civilization of our peoples founded on the principles of democracy individual liberty and the rule of law this goal is laid down in the preamble of the north atlantic treaty. We must constantly remind ourselves, and in particular are young fellow citizens of these foundations of our equal partnership about a deep friendship because our shared fundamental convictions are the key to Unity from unity ensues the strength to attain our goals Safeguard Peace and Freedom for firmness and the readiness for negotiation operate fairly and constructively with the countries of the third world. 
Despite domestic changes in our country and changes of government, 8 american presidents and six German chancellors have contributed towards German American partnership For us germans, gratitude too is an element of our friendship with America.
My Generation my wife and I know from my experience that after terrible war when we we're still children, and students the Americans saved us from Hunger.
We have not forgotten what the Hoover Aid program and what the other aid programs and care parcel gifts have done for us at that time. Americans helped us to build a free state and our constitution especially the catalog for phasing rights holds much for the American Experience of democracy. 
Today, there are 245,000 American troops and their families in our country where they are welcome guests. These troops served together with 500,000 members of the Bundestrie and four of five other Allied countries. What clearer proof could there be Mr. President that we are dependent on one another search between Germany and the United States, and I convey particularly warm regards to all of them today, on my first visit to Washington as Federal Chancellor.
Next year will mark the tricentennial of the first wave of immigrants to America. And to mark this occasion Germans and Americans intend to hold a the big celebration together. We will recall our common Origins and from this past draw strength courage and confidence for our common future. Mr. President, Let us make our fourth anniversary a period of particular, intensive and fruitful German American corporation. Let us start here now. I'm looking forward to this cooperation. Thank you very much."
10219,"Imre Hollai, PGA Inauguration Speech",http://undocs.org/en/A/38/PV.1,Imre Hollai,President of the General Assembly,Inauguration Speech,1982,,"I express my sincere gratitude to the members of the General Assembly and request them to transmit to their respective Governments my appreciation for the honour and the confidence shown my country, the Republic of Panama, by electing me President of the thirty-eighth session of the General Assembly. I trust I shall be able to discharge my functions satisfactorily. I certainly intend to abide strictly by the letter and spirit of the Organization's Charter and the rules of procedure of the Assembly. 34. I will be greatly helped in discharging my functions by having as a reference point and as an example the balanced and calm conduct of the President of the thirty-seventh session, my distinguished colleague Imre Hollai, to whom I express my admiration for his skilful management. 35. I regard my election as a triumph of the international policy followed by my country over the past 15 years. That policy was laid down by General Omar Torrijos when he led my country's long-drawn-out struggle for its inalienable rights, subsequently recognized in the Panama Canal treaties of 1977. It is today being continued with dignity by President Ricardo de la Espriella. 36. Although my function is a collective one, I must point out that I come from a Bolivarian nation of Latin America. Also, I belong to a third world country and share its problems, concerns and aspirations, as well as its efforts that have had so much influence on the course followed by the world Organization during the past three decades. 37. The Secretary-General, to whom we express our deep appreciation for his direction ofthe Organization's work, has emphasized, in his report on the work of the Organization [A/38/1], the urgent need to develop international institutions able to face the harsh realities of our time and to renew sincere efforts at the highest level to strengthen international co-operation, in order to meet this challenge capably. 38. The failure of the meetings of GATT and UNCTAD, the stagnation ofthe global negotiations and the collapse of the other meetings and forums of the North-South dialogue are the result of the negative position taken by the major industrialized countries. That makes it clear to us that the bankruptcy of international co-operation is not just a passing or quantitative phenomenon. On the contrary, there has been a decisive qualitative change: the concept of international co- 1 operation that had been pre( minant since the war-a ! concept based on criteria ofresponsibility and a commit- ("" ment to assistance-has been replaced by a rigid, prag- t matic concept based on cold-blooded considerations of I\lj' , mercantile or financial advantage, in which the devel- . oping countries are asked to negotiate at the same level ' and to r,~ciprocate the concessions of the industrialized I countries. This is accompanied by the consequential l' policy of weakening and obstructing the multilateral ! system of rel~tions by cumbersome legal restrictions, I ' imposing a pattern of bilateral relations that leaves the l "" way open to the exercise of power and influence. \ I. 39. Thus, we are witnessing the birth of a new economic li order, the opposite of the one which we call for and t\ dream of-an order in which the advantages and pref- ~'.'1' erences are given by the economically most powerful countries to each other but denied to the weakest.
A year has pased since the meeting of the IMF in which the Latin American countries were told that subjecting ourselves to strict austerity would ensure that economic recovery would be just around the corner and that only in that way could we overcome the problem of indebtedness. But one year later the indebtedness is increasing more and more instead of diminishing, in spite of the praiseworthy sense of responsibility with which our peoples have been making painful sacrifices to pay off their debts.
41. ParticularlY inequitable has been the handling ofthe indebtedness of the third world countries by the financial centres which charge the poorest countries rates ofinterest and commissions that are much higher than those charged the richest countries or their companies. This unjust treatment is based on mistaken considerations of risk. I would even describe it as irrational, because in fact risk arises when one plays with the fire of misery and the impatience of peoples that have descended to the very abyss of extreme poverty. Finally, it is naive and even dangerous, bc:.th politically and humanly, to supose that the developing countries will postpone indefinitely their hopes for a profound change in the conditions of their existence·-Gf, indeed, the mere satisfaction of their most elementary needs-in order to pay their creditors interest rates which they consider exorbitant and usurious. 42. It is regrettable that the United Nations system lacks any institutional machinery guaranteeing a rational solution to this problem, which is undoubtedly serious for world financial stability but even more serious for the development and well-being of two thirds of mankind. 43. The comments I have just made lead us to share the appeal made to the Assembly with the purpose of halting and reversing the erosion of multilateralism and internationalism at both the political and the economic levels and of salvaging the principles underlying the world Organization, principles that are also the basis of its credibility, its authority and its prestige, which are today being tested. 44. Consequently, we share the firm conviction of the Group of 77 that the global negotiations are a valid and useful means of finding an overall and consistent solution to the world economic crisis. 45. As stated yesterday at the conclusir: of the thirtyseventh session by Mr. Sobhan, Chairman of the Group of 77, ""the General Assembly must not ignore the des:' perate and rapidly deteriorating situation in the developing countries that is the consequence of the mounting imbalance and disorder in the global economic and financial system"" [122nd meeting, para. 17]. The inclusion on our agenda of this important item reflects the wish that the Assembly should undertake the task of launching global negotiations boldly, imaginatively and pragmatically and, more important, as a matter of immediate priority. 46. As I assume the presidency ofthe Assembly, I wish to associate myself with the position of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries as reiterated by its Chairman, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi of India, at the Seventh Conference of Heads of State or Government of NonAligned Countries, held from 7 to 12 March 1983 at New Delhi [see A/38/132 and Corr.1 and 2), when she urged the countries of the third world to resolve among themselves disputes in which they are involved through peaceful talks, as distinct from intervention by third parties. The Prime Minister also urged the heads of State or Government to attend this session ofthe General Assembly with the aim of considering together the principal world proi :1ems and seeking to find fair, reasonable and just soluti,ms for each of the current problems. I hope that this noble initiative willle~d to the best of results. 47. On 24 July 1983, on the bicentenary Of the birth of the Liberator, Sim6n Bolfvar, I had the honour, as .~he persopal representative of President Ricardo de la Espriella and as Vice-President of Panama, to sign in the capital of Venezuela the ""Manifesto to the Peoples of Latin America"" [A/38/325), which was signed by the Presidents of the Bolivarian republics of Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia and Panama, and also the Declaration of the Heads of State of the Bolivarian Republics and of His Majesty Juan Carlos I, King of Spain (A/38/323]. 48. The Manifesto affirms Latin American unity and states that the destiny of Latin America lies in its own hands, thus rejecting the policy of blocs and attempts to link notions of world supremacy with the contemporary process going forward in our countries. The Manifesto also proclaims the Latin American identity of our peoples, within a universal spirit open to the ethnic and cultural contributions of all mankind. The Manifesto further stressed our unity with the other peoples of the third world in confronting underdevelopment and establishing a i.lew international econonic order. 49. The Caracas Declaration states that the historical heritage and moral example of the Liberator continue to enlighten the world and to guide it into the right path. This gives weight to the decision by UNESCO to award the Sim6n Bolivar Prize to King Juan Carlos I and to the South African patriot Nelson Mandela. One ofthem is the inspiration for the establishment and consolidation of democracy in Spain, and the other the purest example ofthe fight against the shame ofracism through. the sacrifice and martyrdom of his struggle in South Africa. 50. On the same day signatures were affixed to the Declaration on Subregional Integration by the Presidents of the Andean countrfe~ , 4/38/329] which affirms the firm support of those leaders for the process of Andean integration, thus breathing new life into it. 51. The Charter of the United Nations, the fruit of a long and tenacious struggle for democratic freedoms, is a digest of humanist thought developed over centuries of culture. Its principles and purposes entail the condition and the guarantee that an end will be put once and for all to the subjection of peoples and nations to oppressive foreign Powers, and that the age-old desire for a humanity free from injustice and disaster will be brought closer to realization. 52. The well-founded hopes that [he San Francisco Charter sowed in the minds and hearts ofmillions ofmen, women and children have been frustrated by the deterioration of the Organization over the years, owing to the lack of political will on the part ofthe super-Powers to solve the serious problems afflicting the contemporary world. 53. Frustration and suffering breed despair, and despair breeds violence. There are reasons to believe that the international tension of our times and the proliferation of conflicts have their roots in the accUlT ulated problems which are considered by United Nations organs year after year without any solutions being found, which confirms the old adage that when the roads of hope are closed, the paths of violence are opened. 54. The United Nations must not slacken in its determination to resolve the political problems which today pose a threat to international peace and security. Among them we might highlight the urgent need to eradicate apartheid, racism and racial discrimination, both in southern Africa and in the rest of the world. 55. UI)ited Nations organs, especially the Security Council, must intensify their efforts for the swift achievemerit by N;unibia of independence, with due respect for its territorial integrity, including Walvis Bay, the Penguin 
Islands and the other offshore islands, without preconditions and under the political auspices of the South West Africa People's Organization, the authentic and legitimate representative of the Namibian people. 56. I consider that the achievement of a just and lasting peace in the Middle East is of paramount urgency. This cannot be brought about until the right of all States in the area to live in peace within secure and recognized borders is guaranteed and until true effect is given to the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people, including its right to independence and the establishment of a free, independent and non-aligned State on Palestinian terri tory, under the leadership of the Palestine Liberation Organization, the authentic political representative of that people. 57. The spirit and letter of the Charter bind us to search for peaceful and just solutions to the alarming situations which have been arising in Central America, the South Atlantic, Lebanon, Cyprus, Chad, Afghanistan, Iran and Irag, South-East Asia and the areas where the fading vestiges of colonialism persist. Thus committed, we must give effect to the concept of a zone of peace in the Indian Ocean and give full force to the Treaty of Tlatelolco on the denuclearization of Latin America, as well as to plans for the denuclearization of other geographical areas. 58. Efforts to foster peace and security in Europe recently undertaken at the Madrid conference have promoted dialogue, achieving results which mark progress, since they were able to harmonize different points of view, taking into account the concerns of various Mediter ranean countries. The Spanish Government, the host of the conference, deserves our gratitude, for it co-operated effectively in the creation of an atmosphere propitious for dialogue and understanding. 
59. The great prradox of our time is that while privileged sectors of the world are rapidly increasing their wealth and their scientific and technological knowledge, in the other sectors material want and cultural poverty are increasing as quickly as population growth. 60. The amounts of money invested annually in the arms race have swollen to overwhelming proportions. This year they will attain $800 billion, which, if allocated to the fundamental needs of peoples, would open the way to progress, consolidate friendship among nations and give greater dignity to man's existence. 61. Thus, it is no mere rhetoric to stress the importance we should attach to the real implementation of the resolutions on disarmament identified in our agenda as ""Review of the implementation of the recommendations and decisions adopted by the General Assembly at its tenth special session"" (item 50]. 62. Let us not forget that last year when the General Assembly adopted its resolution on the bilateral negotiations on nuclear weapons under way at Geneva between the United States and the Soviet Union, it requested the parties to bear constantly in mind that not only their national interests but also the vital interests of all the peoples of the world are at stake in this question"" (see resolution 37/78 A). 63. Nerves have been made tense by a tragic international situation and, with trust placed in the simple effectiveness of electronic apparatus, almost any circumstance could unleash, as has actually happened, the death-dealing machinery of ultramodern weapons. In such cases the most elementary feelings of mankind give way to blind strictness in carrying out military orders. We have witnessed a psychological deformation caused by international tension, which entails as a consequence 
this new reality of our time in which the lives of innocent human beings are at the mercy of computers and electronic instruments in the service of military efficiency. 64. The major Powers want to forget the obvious truth that he who plays boastingly and constantly with a sword always ends by cutting his own hands. 65. In recent weeks we have witnessed a sequence of events caused by major constellations of power which indicate that beyond the interplay of the hostile rhetoric of the cold war what is at stake is the survival of man kind in an insensate competition which takes us in giant leaps closer to a warlike explosion that will detonate a nuclear holocaust. We in the United Nations still have time to avert this. 66. It is an ominous sign that personalities of our time attribute in 1983 to the distressing case of the South Korean aircraft characteristics similar to those of the Sarajevo episode which led to the outbreak of world war in 1914. There has been a similar attitude on the part of the two superpowers with regard to leaving military decisions in areas of conflict in the hands of local commanders without requiring authorization by military and political chiefs in Washington and Moscow. It should be stressed, therefore, that it is important that there should be no restriction or extra difficulties imposed upon the opportunities for or accessibility to dialogue in major international forums both at the world level within the United Nations system and within the regional sphere. 67. The effectiveness of negotiation and the will to engage in dialogue have been demonstrated in the conduct of the Contadora Group, of which my country is a member. The unswerving efforts of tee Presidents of Mexico, Venezuela, Colombia and Panama have led to progress which makes it possible to foresee positive results in the not-too-distant future. The initiative of Presidents de la Madrid Hurtado, Herrera Campins, Betancur and de la Espriella can be seen today in a historical perspective as an extremely fruitful and important act in favour of peace in Central America, which is not subject to the pre-condition of a military victory on any side and does not affect the territorial integrity and sovereignty of the States of the region. 
68. The Organization should adhere ever more closely to its own principles to make its peace-making activities more effective. The vast majority of its Members, developing countries, must play the role of spokesmen for humanity, the instrument of its demand for peace and well-being: and the great Powers, as well as those with relatively less power, must in their turn be prepared to halt the race for predominance and heed this outcry. 69. We must now recognize that along with the tremendous upheavals in the world an institutional crisis is developing in the Organization, which means that the months and the years pass without any solution of the fundamental problems of the Organization and the world community. 70. The work embarked upon in connection with the Opening of a free and frank dialogue between the major Powers is necessary both to bring about disarmament and peace and to enable the United Nations to undertake the vast enterprises the execution of which is linked with the well-being and development of peoples. 71. I realize that I am assuming the presidency of the General Assembly at a critical time in the evolution of the United Nations. We find ourselves at a crossroads, in a situation which could be viewed as a crisis of effectiveness. I say in all candour that if we evaluat: objectively the criticisms levelled at the world Organization wa 
see that it can be described as an entity full of negatives, made up of successive groups of disputants, free in speech but restricted in action. 72. Faced with that situation, I wish to appeal to Member States that through their representatives we should act in consonance and, rejecting any pessimism, restore the United Nations to its proper place and function in the annals of contemporary history. 73. I am now dedicated to working with enthusiasm and tenacity to contribute, together with the Assembly, to che peaceful solution of international conflicts. I shall devote myself, within the framework of the Charter, to the application of methods of negotiation and compromise and to defending with you the sacred dignity of the human person. I shall endeavour to discharge my functions in the conviction that this Organization is the only mechanism through which men of reason and ethics can seek and find effective solutions that will eventually enhance human values and put an end to the use of force, destruction and death as the only means of satisfying narrow, selfish national interests. 74. I believe that we must stress the search for solutions to the problems which beset us today at this historic crossroads, problems which we can and must solve. If 
we fail, I believe we will further diminish the very system of democratic procedures in the eyes of our contemporaries. The truth is that, with the deterioration of the democratic concept of social life, there will undoubtedly come the cataclysm of nuclear arms, with its sequel of destruction and death. 75. The Organization must continue, grow and endure, with the enlightened assistance of Member States and their statesmen. I fervently hope that, united, we will succeed in changing our course and advancing along a new paththe path of justice, the rule of law, ethics and an implacable will to bring about change."

Mit der heutigen Unterzeichnung der „Feierlichen Deklaration zur Europäischen Union"" bekunden wir, daß wir trotz aller belastenden Tagesfragen die Perspektive der Europäischen Union, die Perspektive einer solidarischen Gemeinschaft, nicht aus dem Auge verlieren. Wir wollen eine entscheidungsfähige Gemeinschaft. Wenn Europa die Politik in der Welt mitbestimmen will, wenn wir es vermeiden wollen, zum bloßen Gegenstand der Politik anderer zu werden, so müssen wir alle unsere Kräfte zusammenfassen. Mit der Unterzeichnung der Deklaration leisten wir dazu einen wichtigen Beitrag. Allen Partnern sage ich meinen aufrichtigen Dank für ihre Mitarbeit bei der Abfassung dieses Dokuments. Besonderer Dank gebührt den beiden Initiatoren, den Herren Außenministern Genscher und Colombo. Ich gebe zu, daß die Erklärung in einer Reihe von Punkten nicht dem entspricht, was die Bundesrepublik Deutschland und Italien ursprünglich vorgeschlagen hatten. Wir wären bereit gewesen, weiterzugehen. Als gute Europäer wissen wir jedoch, daß wir alle zusammen nur soviel erreichen können, wieviel jeder für sich zu akzeptieren bereit ist. Der Vorschlag, mit der Europäischen Akte einen weiteren Schritt auf dem Wege zur Europäischen Union zu tun, ist zwei Jahre alt. Die intensiven Arbeiten am Entwurf dauerten über ein Jahr. In dieser Zeit hat sich die Weltlage nicht verbessert, sondern ist kritischer geworden. Spannungen und Konflikte in vielen Teilen der Welt haben zugenommen. Hinzu kommen die außerordentlich schwierigen wirtschaftlichen Probleme, die uns allen schwer zu schaffen machen. Geben wir uns keinen Illusionen hin: So sehr heute weite Teile der Welt die europäische Einigung als eine Notwendigkeit ansehen und ihre Hoffnungen auf sie setzen, so selbstverständlich sie vor allem uns selbst erscheint, so real ist auch die Gefahr, daß wir, geben wir nicht acht, von den Ereignissen überrollt werden könnten und unsere Chance verspielen. Jeder von uns braucht Europa. Die europäische Einigung braucht aber unser aller Anstrengungen. Wir müssen die uns gegebene Zeitspanne nutzen. Lassen Sie uns die Tatsache, daß wir jetzt wirtschaftlich und politisch in raue Wasser geraten sind, als Ansporn verstehen, um Europas Einigung mit neuer Kraft voranzubringen. Dazu brauchen wir eine nüchterne Bestandsaufnahme dessen, was in der Gemeinschaft und in unserer Zusammenarbeit nicht funktioniert. Und lassen Sie uns dann entschlossen und mit Selbstvertrauen unsere Zusammenarbeit festigen: in der Wirtschaftspolitik müssen wir eine bessere Koordinierung und Konvergenz anstreben; in der Außen- und Sicherheitspolitik müssen wir enger zusammenarbeiten, um unsere Freiheit und den Frieden zu sichern. Europa, die Europäische Gemeinschaft, war und ist nicht als eine große Freihandelszone gedacht. Dies entspräche nicht meiner Vorstellung von der Gemeinschaft. Die Europäische Deklaration will neue Gebiete solidarischen Handelns in Europa eröffnen: in der Kultur, in der Gesetzgebung, in der Sicherheitspolitik. Und sie will das, was in den vergangenen Jahren an Institutionen in der Gemeinschaft gewachsen ist, bündeln zum Nutzen unserer gemeinsamen Politik. Für die Bundesrepublik Deutschland kann ich erklären: Wir sind bereit, auf dem Wege der europäischen Einigung weiter voranzuschreiten. Wir wollen dazu alle Möglichkeiten der Zusammenarbeit, die in der Deklaration genannt sind, voll nutzen. Nur so können wir unser Gewicht international zur Geltung bringen; nur so können wir unser Geschick als Europäer auch selbst wieder stärker in die eigenen Hände nehmen. Unsere gemeinsame Aufgabe ist es, für Europa den Frieden in Freiheit zu sichern. Von Europa ist eine gewisse Vorstellung von Menschenwürde, von Eigenverantwortung und von Solidarität ausgegangen. Winston Churchill hat in seiner Züricher Rede vom 19. September 1946 gesagt: Dieser edle Kontinent, der letzten Endes die schönsten und kultiviertesten Gebiete der Erde umschließt und sich eines gemäßigten und ausgeglichenen Klimas erfreut, ist die Heimat aller großen Stammvölker der westlichen Welt. Er ist die Quelle des christlichen Glaubens und der christlichen Ethik. Er war in alter und neuer Zeit der Ursprung fast jeglicher Kultur, Kunst, Philosophie und Wissenschaft. Wir werden dies heute wohl etwas bescheidener formulieren, weil wir bescheidener geworden sind. Wir wissen vor allem auch, daß wir im Laufe unserer Geschichte den uns selbst gestellten Anforderungen nicht immer gerecht geworden sind, ja, daß wir sie sehr oft auch gründlich verletzt haben. Dennoch, was wir in Europa seit 30 Jahren aufgebaut haben, zeigt, daß wir aus unserer Geschichte gelernt haben. Das ist eine Botschaft des Optimismus und des Vertrauens. Sie soll uns vor allem aber politischer Auftrag sein. Der Auftrag lautet, daran mitzuwirken, daß Europa für unsere Kinder und Enkel eine Region bleibt, in der sich zu leben und zu arbeiten lohnt, eine Region, deren Menschen nicht nur einträchtig ihr gemeinsames Erbe für sich verwalten, sondern dieses Erbe auch für die Welt nutzbar machen.","Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen! By signing the ""Solemn Declaration on the European Union"" today, we are declaring that, despite all the burdensome questions of the day, we will not lose sight of the perspective of the European Union, the perspective of a community based on solidarity. We want a community capable of making decisions If we want to avoid becoming a mere object of the politics of others, we must join forces. By signing the declaration, we are making an important contribution to this. I would like to express my sincere thanks to all partners for their cooperation While drafting this document. Special thanks go to the two initiators, Foreign Ministers Genscher and Colombo. I admit that the declaration does not correspond in a number of points to what the Federal Republic of Germany and Italy originally proposed. We would have been ready to go on, as good Europeans But we know that we can only achieve as much together as everyone is ready to accept for himself. The proposal to take a further step towards the European Union with the European Act is two years old. The intensive work on the design took over a year. During this time the world situation has not improved, but has become more critical. Tensions and conflicts have increased in many parts of the world. Then there are the extremely difficult economic problems that are difficult for all of us. Let us not be under any illusions: as much as large parts of the world today regard European unification as a necessity and place their hopes in it, as self-evident as it seems above all to ourselves, the danger that we, we will not give, is also real eight, could be overwhelmed by events and gamble away our chance. Each of us needs Europe. European unification, however, needs all of our efforts. We have to use the time given to us. Let us take the fact that we are now in rough water, economically and politically, as an incentive to push forward Europe's unification with renewed vigor. To do this, we need a sober inventory of what is not working in the community and in our cooperation. Let us then, resolutely and confidently, consolidate our cooperation: in economic policy we must strive for better coordination and convergence; in foreign and security policy we must work more closely together to secure our freedom and peace. Europe, the European Community, was and is not intended to be a large free trade area. This would not correspond to my idea of ​​the community. The European Declaration wants to open up new areas of solidarity in Europe: in culture, in legislation, in security policy. And it wants to bundle what institutions in the community have grown in recent years for the benefit of our common policy. On behalf of the Federal Republic of Germany, I can say that we are ready to move forward on the path to European unification. To this end, we want to make full use of all the opportunities for cooperation that are named in the declaration. Only in this way can we bring our weight to bear internationally; only in this way can we take our fate as Europeans more into our own hands. Our common task is to secure peace in freedom for Europe. A certain idea of ​​human dignity, personal responsibility and solidarity emanated from Europe. Winston Churchill said in his Zurich speech on September 19, 1946: This noble continent, which ultimately encompasses the most beautiful and cultivated areas on earth and enjoys a moderate and balanced climate, is home to all the great tribal peoples of the western world. He is the source of Christian belief and ethics. In ancient and modern times it was the origin of almost all culture, art, philosophy and science. We will probably formulate this a little more modestly today because we have become more modest. Above all, we also know that in the course of our history we have not always met the requirements that we have set ourselves, yes, that we have very often violated them thoroughly. Nevertheless, what we have built in Europe over the last 30 years shows that we have learned from our history. That is a message of optimism and confidence. But above all, it should be a political mandate for us. The task is to help ensure that Europe remains a region for our children and grandchildren in which it is worth living and working, a region whose people manage not only their common heritage for themselves, but also this heritage for the world make useful."
10223,"Jorge Illueca, PGA Inauguration Speech",http://undocs.org/en/A/38/PV.106,Jorge Illueca,President of the General Assembly,Inauguration Speech,1983,,"18. The PRESIDENT (interpretation/rom Spanish): I should like to offer a fr.w brief thoughts on the matter that I have just put to the Assembly. 19. Our path has been arduous and difficult, but we have never deviated from our goal of creating the conditions in which the international community can find ways and means to reactivate the stalled North-South dialogue. However, efforts made so far have not yielded concrete results, in spite of the valuable contributions made by the Group of 77 and a number of delegations which agree that global negotiations might take place in two phases. 20. As a man from the South, from a Latin American developing country, I continue to harbour the hope shared by millions of men, women and chilC:ren of the third world, that the launching of global negotiations will lead to ways and means of raising to a decent level the living standards of peasants, workers, students, mothers and children in wide regions of the world. 21. No one can deny that global negotiations and a constructive, appropriate North-South dialogue would open doors, inject new capital into industry and help put an end to the debilitating unemployment afflicting our populations. We could produce more and sell more if we could get a fair price, and thus pay our foreign debt in an honourable way, not forced by oppressive economic measures imposed by a body which is considered to be a part of the United Nations system. 22. Efforts to obtain a favourable reaction to global negotiations from our partners to the north must be continued, for the economic crisis is not over for the developing countries. The prices of raw materials, in general, are still at the lowest levels in history. Protectionist measures which are applied outside the rules of the international trade system continue to hamper the access of exports from the developing countries to markets in thp. industrialized countries. Capital flows on concesSiOnalj terms have been practically frozen, which has brought about an extremely difficult situation in the poorest countries and has greatly exacerbated the economic crisis 
in certain parts of the world, such as Africa. In Latin America, Africa and in certain Asian countries, foreign debt has increased drastically as a result of the ascending spiral of the high interest rates in the United States. It has not been possible to increase international liquidity to the minimal levels needed to deal 'Nith the balance-ofpayments problems in the developing countries. Exchangerate fluctuations have created uncertainty regarding trade and mvestments and have caused instability on the financial market. 23. There is no doubt that these and other anomalous situations require prompt review and reform in the international trade and monetary systems, which are no longer relevant to the realities ofthe world economy. Nor is there any doubt that the loss of effectiveness on the part of systems of trade and payments has a negative impact on the fundamental aspects of development, such as agriculture .and food, industry, transfer of technology and employmg new sources of energy. 24. Only global negotiations which are universal, carried out with a clear sense of the interrelationships between issues of trade, development financing, the international monetary system and other basic elements ofthe development process will make it possible for the world economy to emerge from the structural crisis which it is currently undergoing and which has played such havoc with the fragile economies of the developing countries. 25. To persist in refusing to launch global negotiations can mean nothing else but a rejection of international cooperation, a withdrawal from multilateralism and a return to nationalistic bilateral approaches, with disastrous consequences for the preservation of the economic and political independence of the developing nations. The continuing economic crisis in the developing countries requires, in my opinion, immediate collective action on the part of the international community. It is my sincere hope that all Governments will renew their political commitment and will co-operate, in the interests of the entire international community, with a view to launching global negotiations at the thirty-ninth session. 26. I thank all delegations for their co-operation. I wish also to express my gratitude to Mr. Sahnoun, of Algeria, and to the Director-General for Development and International Economic Co-operation for their assistance in connection with this item.

10227,"Paul J. F. Lusaka, PGA Inauguration Speech",http://undocs.org/en/A/39/PV.108,Paul J. F. Lusaka,President of the General Assembly,Inauguration Speech,1984,,"Statement by the President 
64. The PRESIDENT: Nine months ago, when we suspended the work of the thirty-ninth session of the General Assembly (105th meeting], I pointed out that at that stage each one of us in this Hall would assess the work of the session on the basis of our respective national policies and perceptions of the Organization, as well as from the perspective of successes and failures. 65. Today as we formally conclude our work and as we make our final assessment or stock-taking, I should like to suggest once again that the correct yardstick of any objective evaluation should be based on the Charter of the United Nations, and that we ask ourselves whether the thirty-ninth session has 
achieved any of the hopes and aspirations of the peoples of the world, which, after all, we represent. 66. When we consider the number of items on our agenda-143 in all-when we consider the magnitude and complexity of the problems which confront us at all levels, and judging from the international climate in the past 21 months, I strongly believe that the thirty-ninth session of the General Assembly did advance the cause of international peace and here I mean all aspects of peace. 67. Some of the problems with which we had to deal with were deep-rooted. Many of them had even preceded the founding of the United Nations. Others were complicated and aggravated, not so much by the so-called acrimonious debates, if any, within these walls, but perhaps more so by human and natural forces external to the Organization—forces such as narrow nationalism, misguided policies, political intransigence, delaying tactics, short-sightedness, honest mistakes and, I should add, the vagaries of the weather-that is, floods, hurricanes and drought. Allow me to mention that much of what is painstakingly accomplished within the walls of this building is often undone or destroyed outside the Organization. 68. What others may describe as the failures of this session of the General Assembly should, in my view, be regarded as unfinished business. The pursuit of peace-peace at home and peace in the world is an ongoing process. Despite the obstacles and despite the disappointments, we cannot abandon the pursuit of peace. 
69. In view of the importance which previous sessions attached to it, and based on my own conviction that economic self-sufficiency is one of the most effective instruments for achieving the goals and objectives of the Charter, I was particularly interested in the agenda item entitled ""Launching of global negotiations on international economic cooperation for development"". Unfortunately, we have not yet been able to reach the stage where we can say with confidence that those negotiations will be launched on a specific date. 70. Granted that the Assembly did not solve the serious debt and foreign exchange problems which are crippling the economies of a large number of States represented here: granted that the threat of nuclear weapons still hangs ominously over mankind; granted that the inhuman policy of apartheid-a subject which has been on the agenda of the United Nations for over three decades has not been elimi nated: granted that the questions of Palestine, Na mibia, Kampuchea and the Middle East, and the situations in Afghanistan and Central America, and others, were not completely resolved during this session; and granted that many of the resolutions and recommendations which were adopted by the thirty ninth session of the Assembly appear to have fallen on partially deaf ears, we should at the same time realize that the Assembly did provide a meeting place for friend and foe alike. In the midst of what some may describe as rhetoric, there were genuine words of commitment and hope. We have already seen some positive results from our deliberations and from the political atmosphere which the thirty-ninth session created. 
71. The seeds of co-operation and consensus which we planted on 3 December 1984 have already bome fruit. I refer to the adoption of a comprehensive Declaration on the Critical Economic Situation in 
Africa [resolution 39/29, annex). Directly and indirectly, the Declaration and the spirit behind it have already saved the lives of millions of our fellow human beings. Here I should like to state that the efforts of the Secretary-General, through the United Nations Office for Emergency Operations in Africa, and all other United Nations agencies and those of individual Governments and non-governmental organizations including those in the entertainment field—deserve our deep appreciation. Unfortunately, thousands of our brothers and sisters did not benefit from these efforts. Assistance came too late. Their world did not heed in time the signals of alarmand, by the way, the alarm is still on. 72. I wish to mention further that, as a result of our deliberations, the World Conference to Review and Appraise the Achievements of the United Nations Decade for Women did take place, to the surprise of sceptics who had predicted its doom. As a result of perseverance over the years, and the spirit of accom modation which prevailed in many areas during the session, we were able to complete a new symbol of comfort and protection for the victims of torture and other cruel and degrading treatment or punishment. 
73. The Secretary-General's profound and timely statement at the present session, on 12 December 1984 [97th meeting, paras. 292 to 307] on the question of disarmament complemented the record number of resolutions which the Assembly adopted on that subject. At least the session placed all aspects of the ans race and the threat posed by nuclear Weapons in their true perspective. The new dimensions of the nuclear age were analysed. The Assembly, through its candid debate, set an example in international behaviour-an example which underlines the view that channels of communication should be constantly kept open if we are to move forward in the area of disarmament. We are therefore encouraged by the prospects for high-level dialogue on arms control between the United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. 74. I still maintain the position which I advanced last December that, in spite of its unresolved and unfinished business, the thirty-ninth session of the General Assembly has fulfilled some of the hopes and aspirations of the peoples of the world. As I mentioned earlier, we have already seen some of the results of the work of the session; it is my camest hope that others will be forthcoming. It will obviously take some time for some of the seedlings which we have planted to grow and bear fruit. They will need attention, care and nurturing. 75. This is the end of an Assembly session; it is also the beginning of the next step ahead on the long and often hazardous road towards the ultimate goal of universal peace. If we do not get there, we should at least be able to say that we have tried and that along the way we made the world a better place-better than we had found it. 
76. Finally, I take this opportunity to express once again my sincere thanks to delceations, to the Secretary-General, to the Bureau, to the Chairmen of the regional groups, to the Under-Secretary-General for Political and General Assembly Affairs and to other members of the Secretariat for their co-operation and assistance, without which I would have found it extremely difficult to preside over the Assembly. I should also like to express my appreciation to the representatives of non-governmental organizations and members of the media, who in their own way have contributed to the work of the session.

10228,"Ronald Raegan, Presidential Inauguration Speech",https://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/reagan2.asp,Ronald Raegan,President (United States),Inauguration Speech,1985,,"Senator Mathias, Chief Justice Burger, Vice President Bush, Speaker O'Neill, Senator Dole, Reverend Clergy, members of my family and friends, and my fellow citizens:
This day has been made brighter with the presence here of one who, for a time, has been absent--Senator John Stennis.
God bless you and welcome back.
There is, however, one who is not with us today: Representative Gillis Long of Louisiana left us last night. I wonder if we could all join in a moment of silent prayer. (Moment of silent prayer.) Amen.
There are no words adequate to express my thanks for the great honor that you have bestowed on me. I will do my utmost to be deserving of your trust.
This is, as Senator Mathias told us, the 50th time that we the people have celebrated this historic occasion. When the first President, George Washington, placed his hand upon the Bible, he stood less than a single day's journey by horseback from raw, untamed wilderness. There were 4 million Americans in a union of 13 States. Today we are 60 times as many in a union of 50 States. We have lighted the world with our inventions, gone to the aid of mankind wherever in the world there was a cry for help, journeyed to the Moon and safely returned. So much has changed. And yet we stand together as we did two centuries ago.
When I took this oath four years ago, I did so in a time of economic stress. Voices were raised saying we had to look to our past for the greatness and glory. But we, the present-day Americans, are not given to looking backward. In this blessed land, there is always a better tomorrow.
Four years ago, I spoke to you of a new beginning and we have accomplished that. But in another sense, our new beginning is a continuation of that beginning created two centuries ago when, for the first time in history, government, the people said, was not our master, it is our servant; its only power that which we the people allow it to have.
That system has never failed us, but, for a time, we failed the system. We asked things of government that government was not equipped to give. We yielded authority to the National Government that properly belonged to States or to local governments or to the people themselves. We allowed taxes and inflation to rob us of our earnings and savings and watched the great industrial machine that had made us the most productive people on Earth slow down and the number of unemployed increase.
By 1980, we knew it was time to renew our faith, to strive with all our strength toward the ultimate in individual freedom consistent with an orderly society.
We believed then and now there are no limits to growth and human progress when men and women are free to follow their dreams.
And we were right to believe that. Tax rates have been reduced, inflation cut dramatically, and more people are employed than ever before in our history.
We are creating a nation once again vibrant, robust, and alive. But there are many mountains yet to climb. We will not rest until every American enjoys the fullness of freedom, dignity, and opportunity as our birthright. It is our birthright as citizens of this great Republic, and we'll meet this challenge.
These will be years when Americans have restored their confidence and tradition of progress; when our values of faith, family, work, and neighborhood were restated for a modern age; when our economy was finally freed from government's grip; when we made sincere efforts at meaningful arms reduction, rebuilding our defenses, our economy, and developing new technologies, and helped preserve peace in a troubled world; when Americans courageously supported the struggle for liberty, self-government, and free enterprise throughout the world, and turned the tide of history away from totalitarian darkness and into the warm sunlight of human freedom.
My fellow citizens, our Nation is poised for greatness. We must do what we know is right and do it with all our might. Let history say of us, ""These were golden years--when the American Revolution was reborn, when freedom gained new life, when America reached for her best.""
Our two-party system has served us well over the years, but never better than in those times of great challenge when we came together not as Democrats or Republicans, but as Americans united in a common cause.
Two of our Founding Fathers, a Boston lawyer named Adams and a Virginia planter named Jefferson, members of that remarkable group who met in Independence Hall and dared to think they could start the world over again, left us an important lesson. They had become political rivals in the Presidential election of 1800. Then years later, when both were retired, and age had softened their anger, they began to speak to each other again through letters. A bond was reestablished between those two who had helped create this government of ours.
In 1826, the 50th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence, they both died. They died on the same day, within a few hours of each other, and that day was the Fourth of July.
In one of those letters exchanged in the sunset of their lives, Jefferson wrote: ""It carries me back to the times when, beset with difficulties and dangers, we were fellow laborers in the same cause, struggling for what is most valuable to man, his right to self-government. Laboring always at the same oar, with some wave ever ahead threatening to overwhelm us, and yet passing harmless ... we rode through the storm with heart and hand.""
Well, with heart and hand, let us stand as one today: One people under God determined that our future shall be worthy of our past. As we do, we must not repeat the well-intentioned errors of our past. We must never again abuse the trust of working men and women, by sending their earnings on a futile chase after the spiraling demands of a bloated Federal Establishment. You elected us in 1980 to end this prescription for disaster, and I don't believe you reelected us in 1984 to reverse course.
At the heart of our efforts is one idea vindicated by 25 straight months of economic growth: Freedom and incentives unleash the drive and entrepreneurial genius that are the core of human progress. We have begun to increase the rewards for work, savings, and investment; reduce the increase in the cost and size of government and its interference in people's lives.
We must simplify our tax system, make it more fair, and bring the rates down for all who work and earn. We must think anew and move with a new boldness, so every American who seeks work can find work; so the least among us shall have an equal chance to achieve the greatest things--to be heroes who heal our sick, feed the hungry, protect peace among nations, and leave this world a better place.
The time has come for a new American emancipation--a great national drive to tear down economic barriers and liberate the spirit of enterprise in the most distressed areas of our country. My friends, together we can do this, and do it we must, so help me God.-- From new freedom will spring new opportunities for growth, a more productive, fulfilled and united people, and a stronger America--an America that will lead the technological revolution, and also open its mind and heart and soul to the treasures of literature, music, and poetry, and the values of faith, courage, and love.
A dynamic economy, with more citizens working and paying taxes, will be our strongest tool to bring down budget deficits. But an almost unbroken 50 years of deficit spending has finally brought us to a time of reckoning. We have come to a turning point, a moment for hard decisions. I have asked the Cabinet and my staff a question, and now I put the same question to all of you: If not us, who? And if not now, when? It must be done by all of us going forward with a program aimed at reaching a balanced budget. We can then begin reducing the national debt.
I will shortly submit a budget to the Congress aimed at freezing government program spending for the next year. Beyond that, we must take further steps to permanently control Government's power to tax and spend. We must act now to protect future generations from Government's desire to spend its citizens' money and tax them into servitude when the bills come due. Let us make it unconstitutional for the Federal Government to spend more than the Federal Government takes in.
We have already started returning to the people and to State and local governments responsibilities better handled by them. Now, there is a place for the Federal Government in matters of social compassion. But our fundamental goals must be to reduce dependency and upgrade the dignity of those who are infirm or disadvantaged. And here a growing economy and support from family and community offer our best chance for a society where compassion is a way of life, where the old and infirm are cared for, the young and, yes, the unborn protected, and the unfortunate looked after and made self
And there is another area where the Federal Government can play a part. As an older American, I remember a time when people of different race, creed, or ethnic origin in our land found hatred and prejudice installed in social custom and, yes, in law. There is no story more heartening in our history than the progress that we have made toward the ""brotherhood of man"" that God intended for us. Let us resolve there will be no turning back or hesitation on the road to an America rich in dignity and abundant with opportunity for all our citizens.
Let us resolve that we the people will build an American opportunity society in which all of us--white and black, rich and poor, young and old--will go forward together arm in arm. Again, let us remember that though our heritage is one of blood lines from every corner of the Earth, we are all Americans pledged to carry on this last, best hope of man on Earth.
I have spoken of our domestic goals and the limitations which we should put on our National Government. Now let me turn to a task which is the primary responsibility of National Government-the safety and security of our people.
Today, we utter no prayer more fervently than the ancient prayer for peace on Earth. Yet history has shown that peace will not come, nor will our freedom be preserved, by good will alone. There are those in the world who scorn our vision of human dignity and freedom. One nation, the Soviet Union, has conducted the greatest military buildup in the history of man, building arsenals of awesome offensive weapons.
We have made progress in restoring our defense capability. But much remains to be done. There must be no wavering by us, nor any doubts by others, that America will meet her responsibilities to remain free, secure, and at peace.
There is only one way safely and legitimately to reduce the cost of national security, and that is to reduce the need for it. And this we are trying to do in negotiations with the Soviet Union. We are not just discussing limits on a further increase of nuclear weapons. We seek, instead, to reduce their number. We seek the total elimination one day of nuclear weapons from the face of the Earth.
Now, for decades, we and the Soviets have lived under the threat of mutual assured destruction; if either resorted to the use of nuclear weapons, the other could retaliate and destroy the one who had started it. Is there either logic or morality in believing that if one side threatens to kill tens of millions of our people, our only recourse is to threaten killing tens of millions of theirs?
I have approved a research program to find, if we can, a security shield that would destroy nuclear missiles before they reach their target. It wouldn't kill people, it would destroy weapons. It wouldn't militarize space, it would help demilitarize the arsenals of Earth. It would render nuclear weapons obsolete. We will meet with the Soviets, hoping that we can agree on a way to rid the world of the threat of nuclear destruction.
We strive for peace and security, heartened by the changes all around us. Since the turn of the century, the number of democracies in the world has grown fourfold. Human freedom is on the march, and nowhere more so than our own hemisphere. Freedom is one of the deepest and noblest aspirations of the human spirit. People, worldwide, hunger for the right of self-determination, for those inalienable rights that make for human dignity and progress.
America must remain freedom's staunchest friend, for freedom is our best ally.
And it is the world's only hope, to conquer poverty and preserve peace. Every blow we inflict against poverty will be a blow against its dark allies of oppression and war. Every victory for human freedom will be a victory for world peace.
So we go forward today, a nation still mighty in its youth and powerful in its purpose. With our alliances strengthened, with our economy leading the world to a new age of economic expansion, we look forward to a world rich in possibilities. And all this because we have worked and acted together, not as members of political parties, but as Americans.
My friends, we live in a world that is lit by lightning. So much is changing and will change, but so much endures, and transcends time.
History is a ribbon, always unfurling; history is a journey. And as we continue our journey, we think of those who traveled before us. We stand together again at the steps of this symbol of our democracy--or we would have been standing at the steps if it hadn't gotten so cold. Now we are standing inside this symbol of our democracy. Now we hear again the echoes of our past: a general falls to his knees in the hard snow of Valley Forge; a lonely President paces the darkened halls, and ponders his struggle to preserve the Union; the men of the Alamo call out encouragement to each other; a settler pushes west and sings a song, and the song echoes out forever and fills the unknowing air.
It is the American sound. It is hopeful, big-hearted, idealistic, daring, decent, and fair. That's our heritage; that is our song. We sing it still. For all our problems, our differences, we are together as of old, as we raise our voices to the God who is the Author of this most tender music. And may He continue to hold us close as we fill the world with our sound--sound in unity, affection, and love--one people under God, dedicated to the dream of freedom that He has placed in the human heart, called upon now to pass that dream on to a waiting and hopeful world.
God bless you and may God bless America."
10232,"Jaime de Piniés, PGA Inauguration Speech",http://undocs.org/en/A/40/PV.134,Jaime de Piniés,President of the General Assembly,Inauguration Speech,1985,,"The PRESIDENT (interpretation from Spanish): As we bring to a close the fortieth session of the General Assembly, I should like to make a few remarks that will be very brief because, although we have had a period of relative respite in the work of the General Assembly, tomorrow you will already be starting another session, the forty-first, filled with items and fraught with unknowns. And so I feel that words are superfluous, since during the fortieth session the speeches were numerous, albeit shorter than on previous occasions. However, I cannot fail to mention the success of the actual commemorative part of the session. It was attended by many top-ranking leaders. If the Assembly had not accepted the limitations recommended by the Preparatory Committee, so as not to prolong the celebration unduly, their numbers would have been much greater. In any case, those who did not attend last yea~ should do so this year. You will forgive me if I digress for a moment and announce that the next session, coinciding with the tenth anniversary of the restoration of the Spanish constitutional and democratic monarchy, will be attended by His Majesty King Juan Carlos I, who will open the general debate at the forty-first session. The attendance of such outstanding figures strengthens and enhances the Organization. At the end of what is considered as the first part of the Assembly session, covering the last three months ~f 1965; ! ~~de a brief statement highlighting ~hat I considered to have been the most important features of the actual commemorative part of the session. I see no need to repeat what I said then. At the beginning of 1986 the Assembly was again very active. For my part I was given the task of appointing the Group of 18 experts to study the financial and administrative situation of the united Nations. They worked hard and finally produced an important report on which the Assembly will have to take a decision. When the Assembly met again at the end of April I took into account the observations made by the Secretary-General on the subject of the economic and financial crisis which is looming because of delays in the payment of some budget contributions. At its forty-first session the General Assembly will have to consider this situation in depth and find a solution. Although it was the sUbject of a special session, • should like to stress the importance of the session devoted to Africa. Because of the approach adopted and the frank nature of the speeches made, the results were highly positive and I confidently expect that substantial progress will be achieved. Beyond all the existing crises and in all circumstances it is essential that the United Nations should continue basically to serve the cause of peace, which we are currently commemorating with a special Year in accordance with the decision taken at the most recent Assembly session. Peace and security are the fundamental principles of our Charter. I therefore believe that it is important for the·organs of the united Nations to try to undertake more of the preventive action to which I referred in my inaugural address at the opening of the fortieth session. In order for this to be done the united Nations must be strengthened and not weakened, but t~~t strengthening of the Organization would be inconceivable without a further strengthening of the authority of the Secretary-General within the terms of the Charter. His prestige is indisputable and his efforts in the service of the interests of the Organization and in pursuit of world peace and security have amply proved their worth. He was right to point out at the end of the first phase of the session that extremely important declarations had been pronounced and numerous speeches made containing highly valuable ideas, but that the time had come for Member States to put those ideas into practice. I shall not dwell on the current conflicts, although unfortunately they are numerous, or on tn· problems posed by the stubborn policy of apartheid, hateful on all counts, on the problem of Namibia, the Middle East or Central America, on the conflicts affecting various parts of Asia, on refugees, human rights, economic relations, external indebtedness and so on. I already referred to these matters in December. Let us hope that the good will and good sense of all concerned will produce some cure. Nevertheless I do wish to refer to terrorism. After the unamimous adoption of very clear and definite resolutions both in the General Assembly and in the Security Council there have been renewed outbreaks in intolerable forms requiring decisive action by the international community. It is not enough to repudiate such actions1 in exceptional situations, equally exceptional measures must be adopted to combat them. I invite the forthcoming session of the Assembly to adopt such measures. It remains only for me to mention the friendship and co-operation extended to me, in particular by the Secretary-General, the Vice-Presidents of the General Assembly, the Chairmen of the Main Committees, the Under-Secretary-General, Mr. William Buffum, and all the Secretariat staff. Knowing the Organization now from outside and inside, I can state that without the devoted efforts of the entire staff of the Secretariat it would be impossible to conceive of a United Nations. I wish to express my deep gratitUde to them all. If in the performance of my duties I have on occasion erred, or if I have not discharged my responsibility to the satisfaction of all~ I apologize a~ seek pardon. It is practically iJlpossible to please everyone when there are 159 Member States, a large number of observers and a very large list of items. I hope, however, that I have acquitted myself of my responsibilities as well as possible,' always remembering that the Assembly entrusted to me the task of l~ading the fortieth anniversary celebrations. Finally, I should like to wish every success to the next President, who '~ill lead the forty-first session and express my heartfelt wishes for success in guiding that session on its difficult and uncharted course. As I end my official functions in the united Nations, all that remains for me to do is to offer renewed expressions of friendship to all and to say that after so many years in the service of this Organization I expect to maintain close contacts with my colleagues and with the United Nations itself, which enjoys my full support. May I express many thanks to all and every good wish for the future."
10236,"Humayun Rashid Choudhury, PGA Inauguration Speech",http://undocs.org/en/A/41/PV.103,Humayun Rashid Choudhury,President of the General Assembly,Inauguration Speech,1986,,"The PRESIDENT: We have come to the closing moments of what has been in many ways an epochal session. For me personally it has been an exhilarating experience to have had the honour of serving the General Asaembly as its President. It falls to me, therefore, to say the last words before the formal conclusion of the session. It has been said that a Greek temple or a Gothic cathedral is never quite finished, for it is in a constant state of embellishment. The united Nations is no different; the Organization is in many ways the pantheon of contemporary values. Every session adds to it, laying fresh bricks, as it were, upon the structure. That is what we have done in the session that is about to conclude. I am happy to be able to say at the end that ~ur session has indeed been a most fruitful one. Though it is for history to pass the final judgement, we can say without fear of contradiction that our achievements have been significant. I believe we can all rest serene and secure in the knowledge of a job well done. Allow me to capture in a few words what I believe was the eBsence of the forty-first session - what our work over the past 12 months was really about. We sought to create a better United Nations for a better world, which had to begin with the restoration of global confidence in the united Nations system. The task was not an easy one. At the end we were, hopefully, able to achieve a modicum of success in the attainment of our goals. That is not to say that the crisis has dissipated in its entirety, nor must we allow ourselves to be enervated by a sense of complacency. As of liberty, the price of a successful United Nations is constant vigilance. Several features marked the forty-first session of the General Assembly, features which I shall briefly recapitulate. We confronted a long agenda, comprising a total of 146 items. Owing to a sense of deep dedication and commitment on the part of all delegations, co-operation and understanding on the part of the Secretariat and leadership and skilful guidance on the part of the Committee Chairmen, we were able to conclude most of our work by the end of November. What remained was the debate and decisions on reforms, on which I shall focus later. In all, we adopted 213 resolutions and 90 decisions. All that was made possible, distinguished representatives - and for this I am deeply in your debt - by your heeding my appeal for a puntual commencement of meetings, by a reduction in quorum reauirements and by organizing the schedule of work in an appropriate manner. There was no curtailment of substantive discussions on any items. We concentrated on the rationalization of work and displacement of quantity by quality. As in other years, considerable time was taken up by discussion of such crucial issues as apartheid, Namibia, Palestine and the Middle East~ Kampuchea, Central America, disarmament, debt problems, human rights and drug traffic. Through rationalization of work the number of resolutions on economic and financial questions was reduced by half. All but 10 of them were adopted by consensus. This reflected the identity of views with regard to some crucial issues. Our work was enriched and our achievement enhanced by the attendance of a large number of statesmen and leaders, some of whom had travelled great distances to be with us, despite many preoccupations. They addressed us, participated in our deliber~tions and rendered us advice and counsel. They included as many as 20 Heads of State or national cabinet and 103 Foreign Ministers. They brought their thoughts, reflections and concerns to bear upon our task and joined hands with us in the cause of promoting global peace, security and understanding. We are indebted to them for their support. As we are all aware, a major success of our efforts has been the unanimous adoption of consensus resolution 41/213 on the subject of the efficiency of the administrative and financial functioning of the United Nations. You may recall that the Group of 18 High-Level Intergovernmental Exper·ts set up at the fortieth session of the United Nations General Assembly to review the matter had made 71 recommendations concerning personnel, administration and co-ordination in the United Nations systems. While the Group could not agree with regard to mod"",£ication in the budgetary process in the United Nations, a number of suggestions in that respect was made in chapter VI of the report. Under agenda item 38 the forty-first session of the General Assembly was required to take a decision on the recommdendations as well as on the suggested modifications in the budgetary process. In my inaugural address as President I had expressed confidence in the political will of the Member States to arrive at a general agreement on the matter. I was vindicated, as was my own faith in the system. What initially resembled the fruitless toils of Sisyphus ended in the successful adoption of this historic resolution. I had put the weight and prestige of the United Nations General Assembly presidency behind those intramural negotiations, and, thanks to the unswerving commitment and dedicated work of ~ur colleagues, the result was a consensus That was doubtless a landmark in multilateral diplomacy. The measures envisaged in the resolution will initiate a process which, if properly implemented, will bolster the credibility of the United Nations system. One of its objects was to ensure the continued financial support of the contributors to the funding of the activities of the Organization. The implementation of the reform measures therefore has a major bearing on this aspect. So far, the reforms that have been set in motion have been able to generate a positive response from a large number of con tribu tors. In the resolution the Committee for Programme and Co-ordination was given crucial expanded responsibilities. It was also entrusted with the task of monitoring the implementation of the reform measures already under way. Its last session provided ample evidence that the Committee has assumed its new responsibilities in all earnestness. As for the administrative reform measures, the Secretary-General has been taking some important steps designed to ensure a lean, effective and efficient United Nations system. The United Nations was born of the vision of its founding fathers to create a strife-free world. They crafted the Charter ever so carefully so that it might serve as a framework for the ground rules of inter-State relationships. However, the system was born on one set of assumptions but was moved almost immediately afterwards by a new set of political realities. The post-second World War political setting has been radically altered in the four intervening. decades. To my mind, part of the cri£is of confidence in the united Nations is owed to this change. The Organization, like all institutions, was the product of the times in which it was conceived and establh:hed. The united Nations has had to adapt itself. to changing circumstances, to the dynamism of contemporary situations. That is what we attempted to do at the forty-first session. That is what might be required to be done again and again in the future. All institutions require renovation and reform to sustain and prosper. Ours is no different. If we had some success in fashioning a better United Nations, have we been able to create a bette world? The query is bound to attract mixed response. OVer the years the United Nations has done much. It has usually reacted to breach of peace by timely action, though not always successfully. But then, signal achievements have been made in the social, economic and humanitarian spheres. The specialized agencies have done yeoman work in this respect. This includes technical assistance to projects, expansion in food production, succour to refugees, eradication of contagious diseases, protection of the rights of women and children, human rights in general, disaster relief and many more. It is evident, therefore, that the United Nations has displayed a remarkable resilience over the years in dealing with the challenges of an increasingly complex world. There is, of course, the scope to make it more responsive to the perceptions and PI'~orities of a changing world. To my mind thera are two areas where the United Nations system could and, indeed, must contribute towards the making of a better world. The first is in redressing the balance between the world's rich and poor. The pride of the latter half of the twentieth century is global fellOW-feeling, an acknowledged and shared responsibility of all to ameliorate the sufferings of some. While some countries continue in their opulence, there are othe~s in whom the,pangs of poverty instill a numbing sense of despair. Co-ordinated action to allevjate th€irsufferings is called for. It must flow from a harmonious dialogue between the nations of the North and those of the South. The urgency increases every day•. In this endeavour the United Nations can and should provide an appropriate forum."

November 15, 1988

The President. I have just completed a highly useful and productive discussion with Chancellor Kohl, on this, the sixth anniversary of his first visit to the White House as Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany. The many conversations we've had together demonstrate not only the close ties that exist between the Federal Republic of Germany and the United States but the warm personal relationship that has developed between us. Chancellor Kohl is a close friend of the United States. His views are greatly valued, and his commitment and personal efforts to strengthen German-American ties have made an enormous difference in the relationship between the United States and West Germany.

Today we reviewed a broad range of important international issues. We discussed how our two countries, working together and within the NATO alliance, could advance the cause of peace and freedom.

The Chancellor briefed me on his recent visit to Moscow. We agreed that important progress has been made in East-West relations, but that much still remains to be done in arms control, in ending regional conflicts, and with respect to human rights. We also noted that the Vienna Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, which is entering its final stage, required a balanced and substantive outcome.

I reaffirmed the strong American commitment to Berlin and underscored our determination to pursue the Berlin initiative I first outlined in June of 1987 when I spoke at the Berlin Wall. That divided city of Berlin remains a powerful symbol of a divided Europe and a litmus test of East-West relations.

We reviewed the positive state of the NATO alliance. While seeking security and stability at lower levels of armaments, the United States and West Germany, together with our allies, will ensure that our conventional and nuclear forces are kept up to date. We also agreed that, for the foreseeable future, there is no viable alternative to NATO's defense strategy of deterrence based on flexible response and a forward defense. The Chancellor voiced support for an international conference on chemical weapons, and we reaffirmed our common goal of negotiating a global ban on these terrible weapons.

West Germany and the United States continue to seek ways to share early the risks, burdens, and responsibilities, as well as the benefits, of our common defense. We reviewed the difficulties each country faces in doing more, but pledged we would each do our fair share. In this regard, I paid special tribute to the German people for the sacrifices they bear on the front line of freedom, which is also America's front line of defense, and reiterated my condolences for the victims of the tragedy at the Ramstein air show last August.

We also revised trade and economic -- reviewed, I should say, trade and economic issues. Both the Chancellor and I expressed satisfaction with the present state of the world economy. I congratulated the Chancellor on the decision of the European Community member states to take major steps toward closer economic integration by the end of 1992 and expressed our concern that this be done in a manner that promotes fair trade internationally. We agreed that trade protectionism must be avoided and reiterated our support for an amicable resolution of the U.S. and European Community trade issues and for real progress during the midterm review of the Uruguay round trade negotiations. I'll have something more to say on that point later in the week.

Helmut, this marks my last meeting as President with you. Six years ago, we stood together as I announced the formation of a Presidential Commission to commemorate the tricentennial of the first German settlement in the United States. Six years to the day, I'm proud to announce a product of that commission: the dedication of a garden here in Washington as a symbol of the friendship between our two countries. In a few months, I'll be leaving the White House. But the garden -- and all it represents -- will remain, to be nurtured and sustained by the friendship between Germans and Americans and by the leadership that you have provided. I'm asking Charles Wick, the Director of the U.S. Information Agency, to represent me today at the dedication of the German-American Friendship Garden.

And, Helmut, I hope you will convey to the German people my personal thanks for their prayers and support over the past 8 years. And let me just add a final personal word to you for your friendship and counsel. Thank you, Helmut, and may God bless you, and may God bless our two great nations.

The Chancellor. Mr. President, Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen, allow me to thank you, first of all, Mr. President, for the warm words of friendship which you have found for my country. The friendship between the United States of America and the Federal Republic of Germany is of existential importance to our country. It has always been that way, and it will remain so in future. It was the idea of freedom which brought us together, and today, more than ever, we know how important it is to stand together to defend our freedom and unity.

Dear Ron, you already mentioned this. Today I met with you for the last time during your term of office. For 6 years, we have worked together excellently. Our meetings have always been meetings between friends. And I would like to thank you from all my heart for this personal contact and personal friendship which we have, for the exchange of experiences and views which we had, and also for the friendship which the elder statesmen gave to the younger statesmen. During our respective terms of office, the relations between Bonn and Washington have become ever closer. And one of the hallmarks of this cooperation has been the fair and open consultation about all matters interesting us over all these years.

Let me cite as an example the alliance consultations parallel to the U.S.-Soviet INF negotiations. They were absolutely crucial to the success of the negotiations. I should also, of course, like to thank you, Mr. President, for your bold and resolute commitment to improving East-West relations. Any kind of worsening of the situation between East and West will be felt like an earthquake in our country, in the Federal Republic of Germany, and of course, first of all in Berlin. I should like to thank you very much also for the sympathy and the interest which you have always shown to us and to the interests of our country, which is a divided country, of course. And your speech very near to the Berlin Wall, at the Brandenburg Gate, is unforgettable to all of us. This wasn't only just a speech but it showed a very personal commitment to the cause of Berlin.

And during your two visits to the Federal Republic of Germany, you have always also raised the issue of human contacts between the United States and the Federal Republic of Germany, and you also paid particular tribute to the contributions which those citizens of the United States of German origin have made to this country. And you've pointed out that these people sort of have had built a human bridge between our two countries.

In 1987, and this year, too, you declared the 6th of October German-American Day. And today, dear Ron, as you also pointed out, the German-American Friendship Garden is being opened not far from here in Washington. And if Charles Wick and Ambassador Ruhfus go there on our behalf, representing us to inaugurate and open up this Friendship Garden, I think this is a show of friendship and of solidarity which will have validity for the future. And I should like to thank all of those who were involved in making this sign of our friendship and solidarity possible here in the city of Washington.

I think we can say, Mr. President, dear Ron, we can put it very briefly and say: These have been good years. I think that both of us have paved the way for development which will be pursued by your successor in office. And I should, at the end of my remarks, mention one important example. I should like to mention the agreement and the commitment which we have made to exchange young people, students, but also other young people who travel from your country to our country and from our country to your country. That is to say, we try to plant young trees so that a strong forest may grow, which serves as a shade for all of us.

Ron, once again, from all my heart, thank you for all you did, and God bless you in all you do."
10243,"Peter Florin, PGA Inauguration Speech",http://undocs.org/en/A/42/PV.116,Peter Florin,President of the General Assembly,Inauguration Speech,1987,,"The PRESIDENT (interpretation from Russian) The forty-second session of the General Assembly, which ends today, has taken place in an eventful per iod of international life. The resolutions and decisions adopted by it are proof of the intensified striving for the international co-operation necessary for finding joint solutions to the problems facing mankind. In my speech at the open lng of the forty-second session I said: IIthere is definite potential for political success in important areas ..• A change for the better, towards an easing of tension in international relations is certainly feasible."" (A/42!PV.l, p. 8) It is not wi thout sa tisfaction that we observe today that the posi tive trends in international relations are being consolidated and having initial results, al though the serious problems that con tinue to exist can na turally not be overlooked. Yet it seems to me that the spirit behind any approach to resolving the problems is decisive. As President of this session I have tried consistently to use all the instruments at my disposal to ensure that it proceeds in a harmonious, constructive and fruitful way. The results of the forty-second session have already been summarized. I wish only to add the following today. In my opinion this session has proved that our Organization is acting and interacting in accord with the course of international relations. The forty-second session of the General Assembly has been a forum of dialogue, mutual understanding and, at the same time, frank and non-confrontational discussion in areas in which differing positions exist. With its main session period and five resumptions, and, last but not least, the holding of the third special session on disarmament, this session has been a time of intensive work. It speaks well for the increasing authority of our Organization that 47 Heads of State or Government and 157 Foreign Ministers have spoken in the highest forum of States during this period. A major conclusion to be drawn from the session is, r believe, that the Organization must be used even more as a centre of dialogue and negotiations to enable it to engage in activities that will make an even greater contr ibution to the solution of in ter national problems. I wish to make another remark on the subject of the various resumptions of the session~ the question of the status of the Observer Mission of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO). It is a good thing that here too realism has gained the upper hand. Our Organization has from the outset taken a stand in conformi ty with international law. In sum, one can say that experience, including that of the session of the General Assembly that is now ending, shows that the task assigned to the United Nati.ons at. its foundation - ""to saVe succeeding generations from the scourge of war"" - has not become any less relevant; that the Organization continues to be the :.mi'lue forum for dialogue and co-operation; that the activity and efficiency of the Organization and its organs are increasing as t.l-te world changes and that the O':ganization provides the means oE multilateral co-operation required by the new dimens ions of in terna tional co-opera tion in resol"" ing global problems as they emerge. In view of the heavy workload and the financial constraints on the Organization, the conclusion of our extensive agenda with good results is a great achievement by all those involved. This has been possible thanks to the purposeful work of the Committees and their Chairmen, Vice-Chairmen and Rapporteurs, whom I should like to thank once again. The preparation and observance of the General Assembly's working schedule in close collaboration with delegations, the agreement to dispense with the quorum in the plenary Assembly and in the Committees when no decisions had to be taken, and the setting of a uniform time for the beginning of is, the meetings of the plenary Assembly and the Commi ttees have proved useful. In my : and the ined ty the : the opinion the continuance of this practice would be conducive to the effective working of the Organization. It has been a great honour and no ordinary task to collaborate w1 th memers in carrying out my function. I thank you for the confidence you have shown in me, and for your close co-operation. I wish to express my particular thanks and esteem to the Secretary-General, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, who has had to manage a very heavy work-load this year; the results of his work speak for themselves. My sincere thanks go to the Vice-Presidents and to the Chairmen of the regional groups. We have worked together to make this session a success. It is with special satisfaction that I look back at a year of constr uctive co-operation with the members of the secretariat, co-operation marked by mutual respect and assistance. For this I address my personal thanks to Under-secretary-General Joseph Verner Reed and all staff menDers of his Office, the Department of Conference Services, the Department of Public Information and the Office of Legal Affairs, as well as all other staff mermers who have contributed to the s uccess of our endeavour s • I am certain that the United Nations will oontinue to grow in international importance, prestige and influence. Let us work together towards this objective. Thank you, and best wishes to all of you."
10250,"Dante Caputo, PGA Inauguration Speech",http://undocs.org/en/A/43/PV.96,Dante Caputo,President of the General Assembly,Inauguration Speech,1988,,"The PRESIDENT (interprEtation from Spanish)' Before declarift9 closed the forty-third session of the General Assembly, I 840uld like, in light of the experience of these past 12 months of joint endeavour, to share with you a few final thoughtS. We are all aware that this session began at a particularly significant time in contemporary life. After many decades of anxiety and confrontation, we had grounds, for the first time in our lives in the post-war period, for hope in fundamental and positive change in internationftl relations. There was a noteworthY improvement in the intp.rnational ~tmosphere as a result of detente and of security agreements bet~een the super-Powers, as well as of concrete advances towards the solution of serious regional conflicts, all of which offered us, at the beginning of the forty-third session ?f the General Assembly, well-founded grounds for optimisrfi-. ~day, we see that that optimism was, in faet, justified. The optimism of 1988 was not unfounded, and it remains so today, notwit~sttmding the fact that on some issues the pace of progress h&s been slower than we might have wished. None the less, in just a few weeks we are going to witness one of the most exciting events in international life' the birth to freedom of a new and proud nation of Africa. The independence of Namibia, achieved through the heroic sacrifice of the valiant Namibian people and with the invaluable contribution of the Organization, confirms and strengthens credibility in our own methods and ~rocedures for resolving conflicts, corrOborating the fact that we are i~deed ~itnessing substantive change in international relations. I would recall that during the general debate last year there was broad agreement that it was our responsibility to ensure that the atmosphere that was emerging be maintained and strengthened. 1 believe that we can say with pride that we have achieved the Objective we set for ourselves in September 1988. From every standpoint, the forty-thi~d session of the General Assembly has been a significant contribution to the strengthe~in9 of an international framework more conducive to dialogue, co~peration and the quest for negotiated and harmonious solutions to international disputes. Tnat means that the forty-third session effectively helped to achieve progress towards the lofty purposes of the United Nations Charter. In that connection we have all been witness to the fact that in almost every discussion a sound spirit of conci.llation has predominated, and I would emphatically urge that that spirit be maintained as a prerequisite for the sucaeSR of future ses8ions. We all recall the meMOrable statements made in this Hall, ~nd, 1n view of their lndisputed significance I would make special reference to those of the President of the Unit~d States of A~erica and the President of the Supreme Soviet of the Union of Soviet Socl~list Republics, both of which were possibly the o most eloquent reflection of the profound change that h~s occurred. I would even qo 80 far as to say that they demonstrate the end of the cold war that hung over our world for so long a time. I believe that, beyond these major events that signalled the end of a period , of confrontation, this General Assembly, this Organization, took major decisions in promoting world peace. Here, I would single out General Assembly resolution 43/20 D on Afghanis~an. The unanimous adoption of that important resolution was a defini~e step towards the establishment of political conditions for a lasting solution to the serious problem that had sundered the Afghan nation for more than a dec~de. The principles reflected in resolution 43/20 remain fully applicable and constitute a conceptual and political framework that is still valid, respect for which, by the parties concerned, will make it possible to achieve rapid progress to a peaceful conclusion to that tragedy. Other important resol~tions were also adopted at the forty-third session, and they too characterize our work over the past months: resolut ons on Central America, on Western Sahara, on Kampuchea, among others. The session that is coming to an end today also served to confirm that this time, more than any other, is the time of the 'United Nations. As the cold war yields to dialogue and detente new opportunities are opened for the system of collective security enshrined in the Charter. The Nobel Prize awarded in 1988 to the United Nations peace-keeping operations underscored the fundamental role the Organization must play in the development and consolidation of an international order basen on respect for the principles enshrined in 1945.
The United Nations today probably has to reassess its role in the world, since A/43/PV.96 11 (The President) and this Organization has demonstrated above and beyond the words of the sceptics From the world of confrontation ~e may be moving towards a world of co-operation, with persevef~nce and discipline it is possible. given good wil~ on the part of all the international scene is ehanging dramatically. At the beginning of the 1990s we BE/ItSW parties, especially the super-Powers, to achieve peaceful solutions to the major prOblems that have afflicted the world during the past 20 years. The Organization has demonstrated its efficiency. The world is changing and we must now meet the challenges with renewed efficiency in this new post-cold-war period. I am convinced that I am reflecting the unanimous feeling of the General Assembly in expressing at this point to Javier Perez de Cuellar the profound gratitude of the entire international community for the enormous effort that he has displayed, for his efficiency and his political tact, all of those virtues have palpably contributed to the cause of international peace and security. At this point I should like to express a few brief thoughts about the political future. I believe that against the backdrop of our common experience a series of political and diplomatic questions emerge for all of us: What will be the nature of this new world which is emerging in the post-eold-war period? What will be the role of our international organizations? Not only are super-Power relations changingr countries are also changing from within. The first world is changing, the second world is changinq and the third world must change as well. The conditions of leadership among the super-Powers that had functioned until the present period will prObably have to be redefined. What will the new leadership be
like? What will be the thinking of that new leadership? The links between allies and partners, between both the United States and the Soviet Union, will most likely A/43/PV.96 12 (The President) BIS/ASW the future there will also be a change in the criteria of security. The concept of different ambitions and with a different potential. There have been fantastic internal transformations that few of us had thought would come about. And what change as well. h\d perhaps we should focus our attention most on the fact that in security based on the balance of terror is yielding to a different concept of type of secu~ity will this Or9~nization and the main leaders of the world have to build? That may well be one of the greatest fundamental chall~ages that lie ahead. Within this framework I think it also appropriate to point out, from my personal perspective, the perspective of a Latin American, the enorllOus chaUenge that faces my own tatin American region. Let us consider just one stupendous event that has occurred in South America. the South American continent for the first time since its independence in 1810 will be made up of democratic nations. Never before has Latin AMerica been as democratic as it is today. By the same token, however, this same tatin America over the past 15 years has not seen any improvement in the standard of living of its inhabitants. We nave hardly ever been aa poor as we are today. That is another new pbenoNenon, the poverty of our democracies. There had been poverty in the past, but not this poverty with democraCl'. So these poor democracies are also emerging not only as a challenge to us Latin Americans, but as a challenge to the world at large, this interdependent world, whiCh must be aware that there can be no tranQuil ·first class· pasBenger if in ·economy class· there is a bomb. We are all travelling together and the problems of one region are indeed a challenge to UB all.
I should like to conclude my statement Expre3si~ my deepest appreci~tion (The President) A/43/PV.96 13 to everyone for the support and the asoistance that you have exten~ed to me .. throl.lghout this forty-third session. Wi thout you~ good will and you!: spirit of co-operation, my task would have been more than difficult. I also want to express, BHS/ASW co-operated with me and my colleagues. They all do honour to the international civil service and are an example of the generous and univ@csal spirit which inspires all the staff members of this Organization. In this context, as I welcome Ambassador Speer, the new Under-Secretary-General for General AsseMbly Affairs, I do not want to fail to express special feelings to my great friend, Joseph Verner Reed, for whose impartial co-operation, intelligent counsel and invariable good humour I shall always be grateful. To Iqbal Riza, Maria Maldonado, Juan Caries Bnndt, Alicia Santomaur:o and all of t~ose who, in their different capacities, collaborated with me, I also want to extend my sincere thanks. In conclusion, I should like to dedicate my last words in this post to my country, the RepUblic of Argentina, which I have tried to represent with dignity and effectiveness. I have always felt that my election represented not a gesture towards. .e, but rather a tribute to my homeland. Following a long night of dictatorship, with enormous difficl.llties, but also with unshakeable will and faith, Argentina is today at last marching towards its destiny of grandeur, a grandeur which in this case is reflected not in impossible feats or unattainable plans but in the strengthening of a democratic way of life that gives priority to and ensures full respect for the tights, the dignity and the civil and political libetti..a of all Atgentines. Thank you, and best wishes to all of you"
10251,"George H. W. Bush, Presidential Inauguration Speech",https://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/bush.asp,George H. W. Bush,President (United States),Inauguration Speech,1989,,"Mr. Chief Justice, Mr. President, Vice President Quayle, Senator Mitchell, Speaker Wright, Senator Dole, Congressman Michel, and fellow citizens, neighbors, and friends:
There is a man here who has earned a lasting place in our hearts and in our history. President Reagan, on behalf of our Nation, I thank you for the wonderful things that you have done for America.
I have just repeated word for word the oath taken by George Washington 200 years ago, and the Bible on which I placed my hand is the Bible on which he placed his. It is right that the memory of Washington be with us today, not only because this is our Bicentennial Inauguration, but because Washington remains the Father of our Country. And he would, I think, be gladdened by this day; for today is the concrete expression of a stunning fact: our continuity these 200 years since our government began.
We meet on democracy's front porch, a good place to talk as neighbors and as friends. For this is a day when our nation is made whole, when our differences, for a moment, are suspended.
And my first act as President is a prayer. I ask you to bow your heads:
Heavenly Father, we bow our heads and thank You for Your love. Accept our thanks for the peace that yields this day and the shared faith that makes its continuance likely. Make us strong to do Your work, willing to heed and hear Your will, and write on our hearts these words: ""Use power to help people."" For we are given power not to advance our own purposes, nor to make a great show in the world, nor a name. There is but one just use of power, and it is to serve people. Help us to remember it, Lord. Amen.
I come before you and assume the Presidency at a moment rich with promise. We live in a peaceful, prosperous time, but we can make it better. For a new breeze is blowing, and a world refreshed by freedom seems reborn; for in man's heart, if not in fact, the day of the dictator is over. The totalitarian era is passing, its old ideas blown away like leaves from an ancient, lifeless tree. A new breeze is blowing, and a nation refreshed by freedom stands ready to push on. There is new ground to be broken, and new action to be taken. There are times when the future seems thick as a fog; you sit and wait, hoping the mists will lift and reveal the right path. But this is a time when the future seems a door you can walk right through into a room called tomorrow.
Great nations of the world are moving toward democracy through the door to freedom. Men and women of the world move toward free markets through the door to prosperity. The people of the world agitate for free expression and free thought through the door to the moral and intellectual satisfactions that only liberty allows.
We know what works: Freedom works. We know what's right: Freedom is right. We know how to secure a more just and prosperous life for man on Earth: through free markets, free speech, free elections, and the exercise of free will unhampered by the state.
For the first time in this century, for the first time in perhaps all history, man does not have to invent a system by which to live. We don't have to talk late into the night about which form of government is better. We don't have to wrest justice from the kings. We only have to summon it from within ourselves. We must act on what we know. I take as my guide the hope of a saint: In crucial things, unity; in important things, diversity; in all things, generosity.
America today is a proud, free nation, decent and civil, a place we cannot help but love. We know in our hearts, not loudly and proudly, but as a simple fact, that this country has meaning beyond what we see, and that our strength is a force for good. But have we changed as a nation even in our time? Are we enthralled with material things, less appreciative of the nobility of work and sacrifice?
My friends, we are not the sum of our possessions. They are not the measure of our lives. In our hearts we know what matters. We cannot hope only to leave our children a bigger car, a bigger bank account. We must hope to give them a sense of what it means to be a loyal friend, a loving parent, a citizen who leaves his home, his neighborhood and town better than he found it. What do we want the men and women who work with us to say when we are no longer there? That we were more driven to succeed than anyone around us? Or that we stopped to ask if a sick child had gotten better, and stayed a moment there to trade a word of friendship?
No President, no government, can teach us to remember what is best in what we are. But if the man you have chosen to lead this government can help make a difference; if he can celebrate the quieter, deeper successes that are made not of gold and silk, but of better hearts and finer souls; if he can do these things, then he must.
America is never wholly herself unless she is engaged in high moral principle. We as a people have such a purpose today. It is to make kinder the face of the Nation and gentler the face of the world. My friends, we have work to do. There are the homeless, lost and roaming. There are the children who have nothing, no love, no normalcy. There are those who cannot free themselves of enslavement to whatever addiction--drugs, welfare, the demoralization that rules the slums. There is crime to be conquered, the rough crime of the streets. There are young women to be helped who are about to become mothers of children they can't care for and might not love. They need our care, our guidance, and our education, though we bless them for choosing life.
The old solution, the old way, was to think that public money alone could end these problems. But we have learned that is not so. And in any case, our funds are low. We have a deficit to bring down. We have more will than wallet; but will is what we need. We will make the hard choices, looking at what we have and perhaps allocating it differently, making our decisions based on honest need and prudent safety. And then we will do the wisest thing of all: We will turn to the only resource we have that in times of need always grows--the goodness and the courage of the American people.
I am speaking of a new engagement in the lives of others, a new activism, hands-on and involved, that gets the job done. We must bring in the generations, harnessing the unused talent of the elderly and the unfocused energy of the young. For not only leadership is passed from generation to generation, but so is stewardship. And the generation born after the Second World War has come of age.
I have spoken of a thousand points of light, of all the community organizations that are spread like stars throughout the Nation, doing good. We will work hand in hand, encouraging, sometimes leading, sometimes being led, rewarding. We will work on this in the White House, in the Cabinet agencies. I will go to the people and the programs that are the brighter points of light, and I will ask every member of my government to become involved. The old ideas are new again because they are not old, they are timeless: duty, sacrifice, commitment, and a patriotism that finds its expression in taking part and pitching in.
We need a new engagement, too, between the Executive and the Congress. The challenges before us will be thrashed out with the House and the Senate. We must bring the Federal budget into balance. And we must ensure that America stands before the world united, strong, at peace, and fiscally sound. But, of course, things may be difficult. We need compromise; we have had dissension. We need harmony; we have had a chorus of discordant voices.
For Congress, too, has changed in our time. There has grown a certain divisiveness. We have seen the hard looks and heard the statements in which not each other's ideas are challenged, but each other's motives. And our great parties have too often been far apart and untrusting of each other. It has been this way since Vietnam. That war cleaves us still. But, friends, that war began in earnest a quarter of a century ago; and surely the statute of limitations has been reached. This is a fact: The final lesson of Vietnam is that no great nation can long afford to be sundered by a memory. A new breeze is blowing, and the old bipartisanship must be made new again.
To my friends--and yes, I do mean friends--in the loyal opposition--and yes, I mean loyal: I put out my hand. I am putting out my hand to you, Mr. Speaker. I am putting out my hand to you Mr. Majority Leader. For this is the thing: This is the age of the offered hand. We can't turn back clocks, and I don't want to. But when our fathers were young, Mr. Speaker, our differences ended at the water's edge. And we don't wish to turn back time, but when our mothers were young, Mr. Majority Leader, the Congress and the Executive were capable of working together to produce a budget on which this nation could live. Let us negotiate soon and hard. But in the end, let us produce. The American people await action. They didn't send us here to bicker. They ask us to rise above the merely partisan. ""In crucial things, unity""--and this, my friends, is crucial.
To the world, too, we offer new engagement and a renewed vow: We will stay strong to protect the peace. The ""offered hand"" is a reluctant fist; but once made, strong, and can be used with great effect. There are today Americans who are held against their will in foreign lands, and Americans who are unaccounted for. Assistance can be shown here, and will be long remembered. Good will begets good will. Good faith can be a spiral that endlessly moves on.
Great nations like great men must keep their word. When America says something, America means it, whether a treaty or an agreement or a vow made on marble steps. We will always try to speak clearly, for candor is a compliment, but subtlety, too, is good and has its place. While keeping our alliances and friendships around the world strong, ever strong, we will continue the new closeness with the Soviet Union, consistent both with our security and with progress. One might say that our new relationship in part reflects the triumph of hope and strength over experience. But hope is good, and so are strength and vigilance.
Here today are tens of thousands of our citizens who feel the understandable satisfaction of those who have taken part in democracy and seen their hopes fulfilled. But my thoughts have been turning the past few days to those who would be watching at home to an older fellow who will throw a salute by himself when the flag goes by, and the women who will tell her sons the words of the battle hymns. I don't mean this to be sentimental. I mean that on days like this, we remember that we are all part of a continuum, inescapably connected by the ties that bind.
Our children are watching in schools throughout our great land. And to them I say, thank you for watching democracy's big day. For democracy belongs to us all, and freedom is like a beautiful kite that can go higher and higher with the breeze. And to all I say: No matter what your circumstances or where you are, you are part of this day, you are part of the life of our great nation.
A President is neither prince nor pope, and I don't seek a window on men's souls. In fact, I yearn for a greater tolerance, an easy- goingness about each other's attitudes and way of life.
There are few clear areas in which we as a society must rise up united and express our intolerance. The most obvious now is drugs. And when that first cocaine was smuggled in on a ship, it may as well have been a deadly bacteria, so much has it hurt the body, the soul of our country. And there is much to be done and to be said, but take my word for it: This scourge will stop.
And so, there is much to do; and tomorrow the work begins. I do not mistrust the future; I do not fear what is ahead. For our problems are large, but our heart is larger. Our challenges are great, but our will is greater. And if our flaws are endless, God's love is truly boundless.
Some see leadership as high drama, and the sound of trumpets calling, and sometimes it is that. But I see history as a book with many pages, and each day we fill a page with acts of hopefulness and meaning. The new breeze blows, a page turns, the story unfolds. And so today a chapter begins, a small and stately story of unity, diversity, and generosity--shared, and written, together.
Thank you. God bless you and God bless the United States of America."
10256,"Joseph Nanven Garba, PGA Inauguration Speech",http://undocs.org/en/A/44/PV.100,Joseph Nanven Garba,President of the General Assembly,Inauguration Speech,1989,,"The PRESIDENT: Not all of the distinguished persons in the Assembly Hall today were present at the start of the forty-fourth session in September of last yedr. Some members may therefore be unaware of just how tentative the new spirit of compromise and consensus that now pervades our world was at that time. None of us could have failed to note, however, the extraordinary change in the image and fortunes of the Organization - the United Nations - during the past year. Where previously there was a gratuitous media reference to United Nations decisions or activities perhaps ooce a month, now there are incessant references to United Nations deliberations in all the media. We fully appreciate that this spotlight derives in large measure from the dangerous and escalating tensions in the Gulf region; this spotlight none the less serves to illuminate other problems, disputes and claims in the previously shadowed periphery of international awareness. All these are steadily progressing into the realm of United Nations negotiation and peaceful confli~t resolution. An anonymous but uncanny vi~ionarT: once noted that: ""the future is related, and indeed indebted, to the past, and can only be. I perceived meaningfully and projected realistically in the context and against the background of historical experience"". Now, as we near the end of the first 45 years of United Nations history, and prepare ourselves to embark upon the forty-fifth session of General.Assembly activity, the startling changes, in spirit and in perception of the Organization's significance and relevance, merit, 1 dare say, more than a cursory ~,lance. Governments in all countries and of very differing political persuasions have continually affirmed, since the first session of the General Assembly, and in as many as possible of their public statements, solid commitment to the United Nations and to all its purposes and principles. They have continued to express, as often as they decently can - sometimes in defiance of contradictory internal situations - their determination to uphold its objectives and to strengthen its effectiveness in every possible manner. Such extraordinary e )ressions of commitment - yet, the United Nations was simultaneously being accused of irrelevancy and incompetence. Why, 1 may ask, this contradiction?
More often than not, there was an undertow of desperation to statements of solidarity: the words had become an act of faith, an incantation whicn all felt obliged to pronounce, but in which no great confidence was felt. The United Nations was impotent. Many of the criticisms then levelled at this institut~on contained more than a grain of truth; the great majority, however, were based on very real conceptions of the United Nations as something above and beyond reality, as a mythical Utopian entity that should be free of all mortal feelings. There was a need for a sharp reminder and this was bluntly delivered in 1954 by John Foster Dulles. He said: ""The United Nations was not set up to be a reformatory. It was assumed that you would be good before you got in and not that being in would make you good."" Our most sympathetic detractors claim that the United Nations - and the Assembly in particular - has managed to function despite the Members rather than in concert with them. Ironically, while individual Governments continue to exert their sovereign rights in the pursuit of the ""national interest"", their ever-watchful agencies and media institutions ware busily pointing the finger, declaring with derision that the United Nations had f~iled. Whenever the United Nations fails, it is because we, its Members, have failed. When one Member breaks ranks, the side is no longer invincible and is threatened with destruction. We must acknowledge, even if only subconsciously, that the United Nations can never be anything but a mirror of the world as it is. The United Nations is merely an assemblage of the multiplicity of individual national States with all their imperfections. When the Member States were bellicose, the United Nations was full of bellicosity. When the world was a world of cold war, the United Nations was a system of cold war, particularly in its first 15 years. When the world was one of rich/poor confrontation as it appeared in the 1970s, so also was the United Nations. And if the world is now beset with nationalism, so too would be the United Nations. The United Nations is as good or as bad as the States which compose it. This realization has been slow in coming, but its arrival is no less welcome. The forty-fourth session of the General Assembly witnessed the gradual assumption by the United Nations of a new confidence and status as it crossed the threshold to regain its long-vacant post of facilitator of world peace and security. The three sp,ecial sessions which deliberated on the destabilizinq and dehumanizing impact of poverty arising from underdevelopment, drug trafficking and abuse, and the nightmare of apartheid, each produced a consensus declaration. The Assembly not only asserted itself on the essential issues of our time but demonstrated, for all time, the remarkable achievement lying well within our grasp when political will is maintained. It is worth recalling that during the forty-fourth session, Namibia claimed its independence and assumed its rightful place as the 160th Member State of our Organization. In adopting the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the General Assembly at its forty-fourth session gave an unlimited guarantee that our civilization will accord due attention to the inalienable rights of children to be safeguarded, to live in a protected family environment free from persecution and neglect. Thi~ is but the foundation. It is a foundation, however, because children in poverty-stricken, drug-contaminated and violent societies, and children enduring under an inhuman apartheid regime certainly cannot be considered to exist within an environment imparting dignity, tolerance, equality, solidarity, freedom and, indeed, peace. Digitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library FMB/8 A!44/P.
This Assembly also emphasized its support of the growing detente between East and West. On 15 November 1989, in unanimously adopting resolution 44/21 on ""Enhancing international peace, security and international co-operation in all its aspects in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations"", we reiterated our collective belief that in an independent world, global peace and security can, and must, be rooted in the work of the United Nations - in the codified rules and principles of peace, security and international co-operation laid down in the Charter. In this context of the enhancement of world peace, the Assembly welcomed the free and fair elections in Nicaragua and looks with high expectations towards the Haitian Government and people for the fulfilment of a similar democratic potential. The painstaking effo~ts of all those involved in the intricate peace-making arrangements in Cambodia have been noted with increasing optimism by the Assembly - an optimism not misplaced now that Prince Sihanouk has announced his intention to preside over the Supreme National Congress in compliance with the terms of the United Nations Peace Plan. And the Assembly applauded as Trinidad and Tobago set us all an example by resolving an internal difficulty and averting a full-scale crisis through adroit negotiation. We commend it. The peace dividend of detente has been met with welcome relief, endorsed fully by the Assembly and rehearsed exhaustively by the world's media. But the real significance of the rapprochement, however, lies in its impact on the role and functioning of the United Nations. It was Sir Winston Churchill who, in 1955, commented with remarkable foresight that ""the United Nations was set up, not to get us to heaven, but only to save us from hell"". The 15 members of the Security Council ably discharged such a mandate by forestalling with skill and dexterity what appeared as an assured, inevitable war in the Persian Gulf region. Nevertheless, the Security Council, within the context of an organization struggling to be reborn, is heir to impulses which are only half-formed and, indeed, half understood. It must be given time in an atmosphere of consensus and unrepenting solidarity to discern, formulate and execute its responsibilities. This wi1.l require the renewed commitment to the principles of the Charter by every Member State, as Dag Hammarskjold, who spent many long hours in these chambers and in the Security Council, would undoubtedly reiterate were,he alive today. His wise counsel is worth recalling at precisely those moments when problems before the Council are at their most intractable - those sessions wherein fact and feeling become so entangled that despair looms. He wrote: ""Never accept what can be gained by giving in. You will be living off stolen goods and your muscles will atrophy.""
It is a matter for regret that the same degree of concern, commitment and collective responsibility as has been applied to global political, strategic and security matters has not yet been extended to the human imperatives of the less. privileged of our world. Just as detente has been achieved by discarding rigid ideologies, so too is a review of the rigid economic doctrines long overdue. The latest World Bank report on poverty paints a stark and rapidly worsening picture of poverty, which threatens to destabilize our world order at least as effectively if not as rapidly as any conflict we now see in the Gulf region. In recognition of these human imperatives, therefore, it is hardly surprising that it is the incidence of human SUffering - the appalling plight of foreign victims of the Gulf crisis, menaced by their host with starvation in defiance of their rights under international humanitarian law - that is poised to undermine the consensus and purposeful functioning of the Security Council and, by default, of this Orga~ization. In the Gulf as elsewhere, humanitarian repercussions cannot be tidily divorced from economic and political issues, in particular when the conflict itself is conceived in legal/moral terms. As we conclude this forty-fourth session, we are mindful that the 245 resolutions and associated decisions taken are geared towards specific issues and precise purposes. We are mindful too that consensus does not necessarily translate into ""democracy in action"". When all is said and done, consensus is meaningless if identified Objectives are not crystallized through effective implementation into tangible results. It is therefore vital that delegations carry this momentum of vision, consensus and courage into and well beyond the forty-fifth session. It would be most remiss of me to close this session without citing for the record the diligent assistance of the Vice-Presidents of the General Assembly. One ma~ in particular, the Ambassador of Antigua and Barbuda, my dear friend The closure of the forty-fourth session can in no way be construed as l!work done""; much unfinished business remains to confront the forty-fifth session. The Palestinians continue to expect and demand their own sovereign State, as do the people of Western Sahara. The peoples of Liberia and El Salvador deserve to live in peace and security. It is upon such delicate tasks that our collective future is anchored. Again I quote Dag Hammarskjold, who once enjoined that ""a task becomes a duty the moment you suspect it to be an essential part of that integrity which alone entitles a man or woman to assume responsibility"". The challenge to keep sight of the wood in spite of the trees is an enormous one. The responsibility for defending our collective interests effectively is yours alone. Failure cannot and must never be contemplated. CLOSURE OF THE FORTY-FOURTH SESSION The PRESIDENT: I now have the honour to declare the forty-fou~th session of the United Nations General Assembly closed. May your God be wi~h you at all times."

You gave her the most tumultuous reception. She deserved it. She led our country for over 11 years, our Party for over 15. We owe Margaret a great debt. The Britain she left us is immeasurably stronger than the Britain she found. Above all, she helped others to believe in us and us to believe in ourselves. And on those foundations she laid three great election victories. It’s good to applaud; it’s grand to cheer. But the greatest tribute we can pay her is to do as she did. To win, and win, and win again. At this Conference - and what a successful Conference it’s been - you have heard how the next Conservative Government will secure the best future for Britain. We’ve heard some cracking speeches this week. From the right team. A young team - in fact the youngest Cabinet this century. A professional team.

Just think for a moment. When the going gets rough in international affairs, who would be the first person you would send for? Gerald Kaufman? No, he would be the second person. The first person would be anyone but Gerald Kaufman. But far and away the best person would be Douglas Hurd, one of the finest Foreign Secretaries this country has ever had. Of course, Labour’s Captain tries to talk up his team. ‘A winning team,’ he calls them. After three election defeats? Well, it goes to show that there must be more than one way to look at history. Take Waterloo. You thought Wellington won Waterloo? No, Waterloo was a smash hit for Napoleon.

But we can all help Labour to win one thing the record for the longest run of election defeats. Played four, lost four. And a probable vacancy for team captain. Last week at Brighton we had speech after speech about a fairytale future for the British people. Then there was sing-along-a-leader. It was all good fun, if you like that sort of thing.

But while this was happening out front, there was something thoroughly nasty seeping from under the platform. I refer, of course, to what Labour pretends to believe are the Government’s plans for the National Health Service. There’s only one way to deal with a lie: nail it to the wall of truth, as William Waldegrave so conclusively did yesterday. We have all been brought up with the Health Service. We use it, we cherish it, we are proud of it. I know that for millions of people in this country the National Health Service means security. I understand that. Because I am - and always have been - one of those people. I know that even when you’re fit and well, it brings peace of mind just to know it’s there. It is unthinkable that I, of all people, would try to take that security away.

A genuine belief I can respect, even when I profoundly disagree with it. But deliberate calumny - repeated, repeated and repeated - merely diminishes its authors. The Health Service has been in existence for over 40 years. And who has been in Government for most of that period? We have. For 29 of those years it has been a Conservative Government. It has been under Conservative Governments that the National Health Service has been built up, enlarged and improved. And our reforms will carry that right through into the 1990s. So let me say now, once and for all, and without qualification - under this Government the National Health Service will continue to offer free hospital treatment to everyone. And so that no one can misunderstand the position - and I hope the whole country is listening - let me make it even clearer. There will be no charges for hospital treatment, no charges for visits to the doctor, no privatisation of health care, neither piecemeal, nor in part, nor as a whole. Not today. Not tomorrow. Not after the next election. Not ever while I’m Prime Minister. And if, after all I have said, there are still those who set out to frighten the vulnerable, the weak, and the old, with carefully calculated smears, then the public will know where to find them - in the gutters of public debate. Such people are not friends of the Health Service. They are the parasites that live on its back.

No Conservative need be defensive about the health service. On the contrary, every Conservative has the right to share my disgust at what is said. Go to your local hospital. What do you find? You’ll find Conservatives. In the hospital shop. Serving with the League of Friends. Working on the wards. They are not just the friends of the Health Service. They are part of the Health Service. The National Health Service doesn’t belong to the Labour Party. As its name makes clear, it belongs to the Nation. And, in both senses of the phrase, Labour isn’t going to get away with it. The Health Service is not a political football to be kicked around in the hope that, somehow or other, it will reopen the door of Downing Street to a Labour government. It won’t. Neither by hook or by crook.

This is the first Conference I have addressed as Leader of the Conservative Party. It is hard to explain quite how I feel about that. It is a long road from Coldharbour Lane to Downing Street. It is a tribute to the Conservative Party that that road can be travelled. Perhaps at the back of this hall today there is another young man or woman who stands where I did 30 years ago. Who knows few people here. Who feels it is a long road to this platform, too. They should remember the last two leaders were a builder’s son from Broadstairs and a grocer’s daughter from Grantham. We don’t need lectures in the Conservative Party about opportunity. We are the Party of opportunity. This Party is open to all. And to all those who may be watching, wherever you come from, whatever your background, I say simply this: ‘Come and join us.’ There are no barriers in our Party, just as there will be no barriers in the Britain we are building together.

Some people ask whether we will have a different sort of Conservatism in future. Of course we will. We all bring our own beliefs, our own instincts, and our own experiences to politics. And I am no exception. But the fundamental beliefs of the Conservative Party, those beliefs that brought me into this Party, are the beliefs that Chris Patten expressed so brilliantly on Tuesday. They remain as strong today as ever. Old though our Party is, the values behind it are older still. They are rooted in the instincts of every individual. And it is through our policies that we make them come alive. What is it that we offer? A strong Britain, confident of its position, secure in its defence, firm in its respect for the law. A strong economy, free from the threat of inflation, in which taxes can fall, savings can grow, and independence is assured.

I want to give individuals greater control over their own lives. Every mother, every father, a say over their child’s education. Every schoolchild, a choice of routes to the world of work. Every patient, the confidence that their doctors can secure the best treatment for them. Every business, every worker, freedom from the destructive dictatorship of union militants. Every family, the right to have and to hold their own private corner of life: their own home, their own savings, their own security for their future and for their children’s future. Building the self-respect that comes from ownership. Showing the responsibility that follows from self-respect. That is our programme for the 90s. I will put it in a single phrase: the power to choose and the right to own.

Do you know what Labour believe? That choice is something for them. They just can’t accept that choice is something most of us can be trusted with. You might make mistakes, they say. What arrogance. As if the State had never made mistakes, in our name, with our money. Try telling that to the tenants of the crumbling tower blocks that disfigure our cities. And tell that to the citizens of Eastern Europe, who have risked their very lives for these freedoms, for the right to own, and for the power to choose. Ordinary values for which ordinary people have, in our time, fought an extraordinary fight.

During the summer, I did quite a bit of travelling: Headingley, Edgbaston, Trent Bridge, Lord’s, the Oval. Also Moscow, Peking, Hong Kong and Kennebunkport. Wherever I went abroad, I found the same story. Britain is respected again. We don’t always realise the admiration and affection for Britain abroad. We’ve earned it, because when others have hesitated, we have always stood firm and given a lead.

As we did again this year. In defence of freedom in Kuwait. We didn’t want that war, its waste, its suffering, its grief. But to achieve greater security in the world, we had to reverse the annexation of Kuwait. And to keep that security we must destroy Iraq’s nuclear weapons capacity. They are still trying to cling to it, still cheating, still lying. They cannot be permitted to succeed. One way or another, that nuclear capacity must go. I hope it will go peacefully. If not, it must go by force. But go it will.

In January I flew by helicopter over our army in the Gulf. I can still see the scene below me. A great convoy of troops and heavy equipment moving forward across the sands. For mile after mile. You could only marvel at the organisation and planning involved. But down on the ground, I had a different impression. Dug into position, each unit seemed almost alone. Young men, mostly very young, thousands of miles from home in the wastes of the desert.

Let me tell you what was in my mind when I met them. What would they think? Here was a new Prime Minister, unknown to them, untried, asking them to prepare for battle, perhaps not to return. How would they respond to that? And would they understand the reasons why they were there? Whatever doubts I had soon disappeared. They knew why they were there. They knew the cause was right. And they knew that they could do the job. They asked only to be allowed to get on with it. And, when they did, my goodness, how they proved their point. They really were the best of Britain.

I learned something else from that extraordinary war, and especially from that precision bombing that amazed the world. It’s this: If our troops are to do the job we ask, it is absolutely vital that their equipment and their training are the best. That is why in the last few weeks we have bought the new anti-submarine helicopter from Westland - the best. Why we are moving ahead with the new Challenger tank from Vickers - the best. And that’s why we will keep our own independent nuclear deterrent, Trident. The best security for Britain. And we will take with just a little pinch of salt the conversion of those who campaigned for CND for the past thirty years and then suddenly let their principles - what was the word? - lapse. What principles? First, peace at any price. Then power at any price. I know what this country will say to that. Never at any price. For a man with no fixed view on the defence of Britain, there can be no fixed abode in Downing Street.

As we saw again in the aftermath of war, a confident Britain is a force for good in a troubled world. If we had not created those safe havens in Iraq, hundreds and thousands of Kurdish people would have died last winter in bitter, freezing mountains. We spoke out strongly for human rights in Peking and spoke out first against the return of tyranny in Moscow. Alone among all the nations of the world we stand at the hub of three great interlocking alliances. Of NATO, which is and must remain the core of our defence. Of the European Community. And of the Commonwealth, which meets in conference next week. There we must persuade 50 nations, some - frankly - with a chequered political history, to a formal commitment to democracy and human rights.

And in the 1990s, I hope to see one former member of the Commonwealth once more take its rightful place. We have always fought for an end to apartheid. But we have worked just as consistently for the long-term goal of a fully free and prosperous South Africa. I believe that both goals are now in sight. And when they are reached I want to see South Africa back where she belongs - as a fully-fledged member of our Commonwealth of nations.

A great debate is now underway in Europe. One in which the Conservative Party can speak with authority. Harold Macmillan first sought to take Britain into the Community, Ted Heath finally led us there, and Margaret Thatcher signed the Single European Act - with its vision of ever-closer union between states. Closer union between states. Not a federal merger of states. That is still our policy.

I believe strongly in partnership in Europe. Britain, as a great European power, has gained from our membership of the Community. That is the verdict of those people in our country who live by business, banking and trade, the very people on whom our prosperity and jobs depend. But it must be the right Europe. Let me set out for you the objectives that I have in mind, the principles that I will fight for, and the propositions I will resist.

First, we want a Community that will in time embrace the new democracies of the East. We have the chance to heal the scar that divided and disfigured Europe for two generations. The nations of Eastern Europe - Hungary, Poland, Czechoslovakia, the Baltic States - need to know now that when their economies are ready for the Community, the Community will be ready for them. Second, I want a genuine single market, open for business right across the Community. It must have common rules. And these rules must be obeyed. When we sign up to something, we put words into action. Some of our partners, I fear, are keener on making new rules than on keeping them. We need a system that can deal effectively with those who call themselves good Europeans, but who hijack lorries or hold up free trade.

We are now negotiating new Treaties on political and economic union. I am always ready to listen to new ideas. But they must be workable ideas. Ideas that make sense for Europe, and for Britain. There are vital issues at stake. They involve hard judgments of where our true interests lie. The idea of a single European currency is one with enormous ramifications, both practical and political. At best, it is an uncertain prospect. Any treaty must provide for a separate decision to be taken - not now - but at a future date by the British Government and the British Parliament. It’s our decision. A single currency cannot be imposed upon us. And I would not accept, on behalf of Britain, any treaty which sought to impose a single currency - at however distant a date.

We already work closely with our European partners in financial affairs. So, too, in foreign policy and defence. When national interest and Community interest coincide, then common action is only common sense. But in no circumstances - not now, not at Maastricht - will a Conservative Government give up the right, our national right, to take the crucial decisions about our security, our foreign policy and our defence. We are working to reach an agreement at Maastricht in December. But I cannot guarantee that our negotiations will succeed. For it is no easy task to get 12 nations to agree. And for my part, I shall put the interests of our country before any agreement. Not any agreement before the interests of our country.

I hope we can reach agreement. If we do, I will submit that agreement to Parliament, for it is here in Britain that the crucial decisions must be taken. Not in the European Parliament. Not in the Council of Ministers. Not in the Commission - certainly not in the Commission. It will be for Parliament to decide on behalf of the people of Britain who elected it.

So far I have spoken of alliances. Of how much we can achieve if we work with other nations. But when it comes to the search for new markets, even our closest allies remain our competitors. I have never accepted the craven argument that Britain can’t compete with Germany or Japan. And I have contempt for the defeatists who run down our country and write off its future. Those who said we couldn’t compete in Europe when we led Britain into the Exchange Rate Mechanism. Those who said that we would have to push up interest rates. And that our inflation was bound to stay far higher than the rest of the Continent. All that was just a year ago this week. And look what has really happened since. We have cut interest rates eight times. Our exports to the rest of the Community have shot up. Our imports have fallen. Our trade deficit with Europe has been almost wiped out.

And in case you haven’t heard this morning’s news, our inflation rate has fallen to just 4.1 per cent. For the first time in a generation, we have brought inflation down to German levels. They said we couldn’t do it. We did it, and in just one year. Let me remind the ‘sell Britain short’ brigade of just a few facts. We attract more American investment than any other European country, and twice as much investment from Japan. Only two years ago, this country had a £17,000 million deficit on manufactured trade. This summer, we had a surplus. Our manufacturers sold more abroad than ever before. They didn’t sell Britain short. They sold for Britain. And they had to fight for their markets when the going was hard.

I know times have been tough. Unemployment has risen. Many people have faced great difficulties. I know how they feel - what it’s like for a family when a business collapses. What it’s like when you’re unemployed and when you have to search for the next job. I have not forgotten - and I never will. It is because of that that I will never play fast and loose with the economy. Many have pressed us to do so this past year - siren voices, urging us on to the rocks of inflation, and off the course to recovery. The Chancellor and I ignored those voices. And, as he told you, we can now see the way ahead, out of recession, to the recovery that will bring investment. To the investment that will bring jobs. And the clearer the signs of recovery, the louder the Labour Party complains.

Look how they rounded on the Governor of the Bank of England. All because he dared to confirm what everyone else was saying. That recovery is on the way. When he said there was a recession they cheered him. When he said it was coming to an end they called for his head. What are they going to do with those hundreds of businessmen telling the CBI exactly the same thing? Will Labour threaten to sack them too? All of them? Do Labour realise what their policies would do to business? Stab it in the back just when it’s winning the battle for trade. Impose new levies. Pile on new costs. Bring back union power.

It may be true that a Labour Prime Minister would no longer get his marching orders over beer and sandwiches at No. 10. No. In these days of designer socialism, he’d get them over a G&T - down at the old T&G.

A minimum wage would create the very unemployment they claim to care about. New burdens would drive business out of markets. Higher taxes would drive business talent abroad. Above all, inflation would drive our economy out of the future and back to the past. Remember who suffers from inflation. Infant businesses. People on fixed incomes. Pensioners.

Inflation is a tax paid by those least able to protect themselves. It is Labour’s invisible tax. It wouldn’t come through the letter box, though there are plenty that would. They have eight new taxes lined up already. Well, that’s not surprising. We’ve costed Labour’s spending promises. £35 billion extra and still rising. Of course, they say there would be hardly any more tax for hardly anyone. But that’s hardly credible. The next Labour Manifesto will be the biggest tax demand in history. They love nationalisation. High taxes nationalise choice. It won’t be a case of ‘you pays your money; you takes your choice.’ It will be they take your money; they take your choice.

High taxes would enrich the businesses, the laboratories, and the universities of America and the rest of Europe at the expense of the businesses and universities of Britain. We’d be back with something we haven’t heard of for twelve years - the brain drain. Our low tax policies have built up a brain bank for Britain. Our Party has always kept personal tax rates down. And in the next Parliament we will go on doing so. Lower taxes don’t just mean richer people. They mean a richer life. A life with wider horizons, in which people can develop their interests. Support their favourite charity, pursue their hobbies. Go fishing or to a football match, the theatre or the cinema, or just save up for a holiday. But lower taxes give people more powerful choices, too. The chance to save for the long-term, to invest in the future. Building up a pension. Starting a business. Giving their children a good start in life - and passing on to them the fruits of a lifetime’s work.

In the 1980s we began a great revolution. Our aim was a life enriched by ownership, in which homes, shares and pensions were not something for others, but something for everyone. We can now see the lifeblood of ownership of wealth running through the veins of the country. Nearly four million more families own homes. And eight million people more own shares. And four and half million people now have personal pensions. But this revolution is still not complete. In the 1990s we must carry it further. We must extend savings and ownership in every form. And we now have the chance to make enduring change. For people in their middle years are inheriting homes, businesses, farms on a scale never before seen. The pioneers of the property owning democracy are the parents of the capital owning democracy to come.

We Conservatives have always passed our values on, from generation to generation. I believe that personal prosperity should follow the same course. I want to see wealth cascading down the generations. We do not see each generation starting out anew, with the past cut off and the future ignored. So, in the next Parliament, I believe that we must go much further in encouraging every family to save and to own. To extend every family’s ability to pass on something to their children, to build up something of their own for their own. Labour have their eyes on the money stored in the homes in which millions of people now live and in the businesses they have created. But I believe that what people have worked to build up in life, the State should never destroy. As Harold Macmillan once memorably put it: people walk in public gardens, but they tend their own. I want to build a pride in our common inheritance of town and city, coast and countryside. In the very fabric of our nation.

I want to foster ownership in its widest sense. In making people feel that public property belongs to them. Giving them more say at the local level in how things are run. Giving them a choice. Putting them in control. That’s the idea behind our Citizen’s Charter about which Francis Maude spoke so well yesterday. It will be a centrepiece of our policies for the 1990s. I want to see public services in which the passenger, the patient, the parent can have confidence. And in which public servants can have pride.

I see that Labour are now trying to copy my ideas. I suppose we shouldn’t be too surprised at that. Even the Labour Party has to have some good ideas amongst all the bad. It’s just that they filch the good ideas from us. The bad ones, of course, they think up for themselves. They don’t even hide it when they steal some of my clothes. Did you see how many of them were wearing grey suits last week? Have they no shame?

The test for Labour will come in the next session of Parliament. We will be legislating on the Citizen’s Charter. We shall be giving parents a greater say in schools. Making the big utilities more responsive to customers. And, as Michael Heseltine promised us yesterday, exposing incompetence in the council chamber. And how do you imagine Labour will vote? With us? For the Charter? And for the consumer? Or against us? For the trade unions? For the old ways? For the past? But it’s not just a matter of changing the way we run things. It’s a matter of breaking down the false and futile divisions, based on class and envy, that have been around for generations. They are wholly artificial.

Labour fosters those divisions. It thrives on them. Our task is to end them for good. I spoke of a classless society. I don’t shrink from that phrase. I don’t mean a society in which everyone is the same, or thinks the same, or earns the same. But a tapestry of talents in which everyone from child to adult respects achievement; where every promotion, every certificate is respected; and each person’s contribution is valued. And where the greatest respect is reserved for the law.

There can be no harmony in a lawless society. The recent outbreaks of violence in some of our council estates involved a brutal disrespect for other people and their property. Such behaviour cannot be excused and will not be tolerated. In the face of such violence, I know this Party will give the police the support that we always have. We admire the bravery and the professionalism of those young policemen and women who have been the front line against violent attacks. This Conference must leave no shred of doubt. Rioting is a crime, a serious crime. And it will be dealt with as such.

But dealing with crime is not just something for other people the police, or the courts, or the Government. It’s a challenge to everyone. And the way to fight crime is to change the attitudes that lie behind crime. The attitudes of people who say that theft or vandalism are somehow less serious. They call it ‘property crime.’ Property crime? Tell that to the widow who has been robbed of treasured mementoes of her past life. That’s not a property crime, it’s a personal wound that can never be healed.

This Government is going to crack down on crime, as Ken Baker made clear this week. Let me give you an example. What the irresponsible call ‘joyriding,’ we know as simple theft; dangerous driving, a disregard for human life, and the destruction of other people’s property. Some of these people are too young for a licence. We will ensure that when they reach driving age they can be banned from the road. As for those parents who stand by and watch while their children commit crimes, they are going to be held responsible for their children’s actions. Those in authority - parents and teachers as well - should use their authority to teach a sense of respect for others, for their rights, not just your own; for their opinions, their welfare and their possessions. Without respect for others, there can be no proper respect for the law.

We don’t help our children by excusing bad behaviour, we betray them. And we lead them into worse behaviour. Sometimes it’s right to say no. A great deal has been written about my education. Never has so much been written about so little. Perhaps that’s why I am so keen on the subject. I believe that Ken Clarke’s programme of reform is a turning point in education. It will mean that parents and pupils come first, that the key subjects are studied properly, and that the status of teachers is restored. Some have said that Ken Clarke and I are wrong to insist on simple pencil and paper tests for children in schools. Well, I’ll tell you what marks I would give to people like those. Nought out of ten for concern. Nought out of ten for interest in our children. Nought out of ten for commonsense. And, so long as there is a Conservative Government, they’ll get nought out of ten for influence in our schools.

It will take more than platitudes in Brighton to efface the memory of years of left-wing vandalism in our classrooms. And we will take no lectures from those who led the long march of mediocrity through our schools. What Labour Governments did, and what all too many Labour Councils are still doing, is unforgivable - the years of levelling down; the destruction of good schools; the harassment of good teachers; the kicking away of the ladder of opportunity by those who climbed up it themselves; the setting of the union rule book above all other text books; the neglect even of spelling. That is where the long march of the Left in education has led us. Well, we are now rooting these ideas out. We are giving parents more influence in schools. If we want them to exercise responsibility for their children, we must give them a say in the education of their children. I will fight for my belief in a return to basics in education. The progressive theorists have had their say. And they’ve had their day.

In the last twelve months we have seen the Socialist philosophy collapsing in ruins. Who will ever forget those days of high drama in the Soviet Union last August? Or the three young men in Moscow who gave their lives for reform. When I visited the place where they died, I was struck by the number of young people who pressed in around me. They had copied Western fashions, wore Western gear. For decades, they and their parents had been taught that Socialism was the destiny of the future. That the Soviet Union would bury the West. But it wasn’t the West that the Socialist system had buried. It was the hopes and dreams of their own people. Socialism has gone in Czechoslovakia, gone in Poland, gone in Hungary, gone even in Sweden. And here in Britain, I’ll tell you what you’ll see over the next few months. You’ll see the Red Flag dying here. It’s going. Going. Gone. Suddenly, it’s just so old fashioned, so irrelevant, so out of date.

What I owe to this country and to its people is difficult to put into words. My greatest wish now is to give back something of what I have been given. I want to work for a Britain that is the best educated and the best governed. Where schools and universities are the finest and accessible to all. Where inner cities don’t mean deprivation, but communities that bind and belong. And where no one has to go in fear at night. I should like to live in a world where opportunity is for everyone, where peace is truly universal, and where freedom is secure. If that is what you believe in, then go back to your constituencies. Tell them what we stand for. Tell them what we care for. And ask them to choose."
10259,"Guido de Marco, PGA Closing Speech",http://undocs.org/en/A/45/PV.82,Guido de Marco,President of the General Assembly,Inauguration Speech,1990,,"CONCLUDING ADDRESS BY THE PRESIDENT 
The PRESIDENt: Bringing to a conclusion the forty-fifth slssion of tbe United Nations General Assembly carries with it a measure of satisfaction that the United Nations has passed during the last 12 months a credibility test after living throuqh agonizing decisions at a time of a renewed faith in peace, justice and freedom. 
Living the Charter of the United Nations, inspired by the tragedies of a war, the conse~uences of which have perhaps only now ended, is in itself a demanding task. 
The Assembly has tried, during this forty-fifth session, to understand itself and its role in an international scenario which has revolutionized the global situation. 
During the course of the last 12 months the United Nations took one of the momentous decisions of its forty-five-year history. 
Security Council resolution 678 (1990) was a far-reaching decision. It played a vital role in the liberation from occupation of one of the Organization's long-standing Members. It reaffirmed the central role that the United Nations can, and should, play in the conduct of international relations. It underlined our collective determination to ensure that in a new world order, free from the constraints of super-Power confrontation, it will be the strengtll of law and not the law of strength that ""ill prevail. 
Few will deny that the adoption of Security Council resolution 678 (1990) was a most difficult and painfUl decision to take. Ours is an Organization dedicated to peace and to the peaceful settlement of disputes. Wisdom and experience teach us that sometimes it is necessary to take up arms in the defence of peace. Yet taking up arms is in one respect also a sign of  failure - the failure to find alternative, non-violent means of solving our differences. 
This Assembly, in terms of Article 11 of the Charter, in considering the general principles of cocperation in the maintenance of international peace and security, may deem it proper to examine the circumstances and the mechanisms required in the use of armed force, bearing in mind the principle of proportionality and humanitarian aspects involved. 
The General Assembly may make recommendations in regard to such principles both to its members and to the Security Council. It is a problem requiring the sensitivity of members, dictated by the necessity to avoid appeasement in the face of aggression and, at the same time, avoid war-mongering noises which lead to confrontational positions precipitating the use of force. 
The General Assembly, within this co~tezt, and through its clarity of thinking, has to avoid double-standard approaches where circumstances, both present and future, may lead to situations which may harm the credibility of the Organization. 
In its involvement in troublesome missions, the United Nations is giving encouraging signs that the painstaking method of persuasion and diplomacy can also achieve results. 
The latest developments regarding Cambodia are the clearest cases in point. 
The Secretary-General's efforts on Cyprus may have lately been giving promise of measured progress. 
Tomorrow our Organization will be enriched by the admission of seven new members. In the case of five of them - the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Republic of Korea, as well as the three
process of patient diplomacy, the thrust of events and a realistic approach have been effective in bringing these countrios to the stage where they can take their rightful place among the community of nations. 
We also cannot fail to reflect that these very days the Secretary-General is involved in what will, hopefully, be the final steps of his persistent and tenacious quest for a resolution of the hostage problem in Lebanon. 
In our reviewing the achievements of our Organization in the recent past, related considerations arise. We should reflect that, besides the encouraging developments in the international scene, there are some persistent failures. 
There is the failure to launch an effective process for a settlement of the Middle East problem, in spite of the many continuing and laudable efforts in this direction. The Middle East problem has a dimension which goes far beyond the immediate issue of the Arab-Israeli conflict. 
There is the equally serious failure to launch a comprehensive and meaningful North-South dialogue. While some parts of the world are achieving political freedom, many parts of the world are seeing that whatever freedom they achieved through the decolonization process, in which our Organization was deeply involved, is being jeopardized by poverty, underdevelopment and fratricidal strife. 
The elimination of apartheid in South Africa, though making progress, is still turning out to be more difficult than most of us would have thought. Problems and danger points persist in the various regions of the globe. I believe that in many instances our Organization may not be putting all of its many resources at the disposal of the international community in the search for solutions to outstanding problems. 
I am thinking in particular of the greater role that the General Assembly of the United Nations cau, and should, play in tho condu~t of all aspects of international relations. I am also thinking of the limited impact that our Organization a~ill has on issues relating to economic and social development at both the nation&l and the global .levels - this in spite of the wealth of organs and institutioDs, ranging from specialized agencies to expert bodies, and the considerable resources which it has available for this purpose. 
During the tenure of my presidency of the General Assembly I made it a primary objective to generate thinkinq on the revitalization process of this Assembly. This was done in the firm conviction that the recent developments in the world order have created a unique opportunity to unleash the vast potential for deliberation and decision-making that has, to a certain extent, lain dormant in our Assembly for over four decades. 
I believe in a second-generation United Nations, a United Nations rooted in the principles and aspirations which went into its foundation 45 years ago, but taking nourishment from the breath-taking developments in international relations that have been occurring in recent years and have gathered even greater momentum over the last few months. 
The General Assembly can, and should, be at the heart of these developments. It is the only principal organ under the Charter in which not only are all members equal, but in which all members are permanGnt members. It is the organ which has both the authority and capacity to deliberate on all matters which affect international relations. It is the unique forum where issues can be ~onsidered in their interrelated aspects, where all parties to a problem can be consulted simultaneously and where the process of decision-making could be complemented by an effective process of implementation. 
It is important that a balanced institutional relationship be maintained within and between the principal organs of the Ornanization, including the General Assembly, the Securi~y Council and the Secretariat. I find confirmation of this thinking in the Secretary-General's report that this 
""is not merely an issue of the internal working of the Organi:lation; it bears on the guardianship Qf peace exercised by the United Nations"". (A/46/1, p. 20) 
Our Assembly has for many years suffered the debilitating effec~ of a confrontational world order which was inimical to its essential vocation for proper deliberation and collective decision-making. For many years we have spoken over each other's heads, rather than to each other's minds. For many years we have adopted decisions, many even by consensus, some of which none of us ever expected or intended to see implemented. For many years - too many years - the annual sessions of the Assembly became a ritual procedura1ly intensive for the first three months and then performing 04 a sporadic basis for the rest of the year, not always with direct relevance to what was actually happening in th~ world outside. 
None will contest that the time for change has arrived but that change has not yet really taken place. In the intensive conSUltations conducted during the last 12 months over the question of the revitalization of the General Assembly, I have identified three areas where major reform is essential in order to fully exploit the Assembly's basic democratic structure. The essential object of my consultations was to make the Assembly' both relevant and efficient, since efficiency without rel~vance may, in my view, be a retrograde step. 
First, we must make better use of and, where necessary, adapt existing internal structures and procedures. This is needed to make them reflect the role of the Assembly to be present and active in all global issues. The Assembly has to live up to the responsi~ilities entrusted to it by the Charter in order that it b~ relevant. 
Secondly, we must take a close look at the decision-making process and its follow-up. This is needed to give both meaning and authority to the Assembly's deliberations, and hence to make it efficie~t. 
Thirdly, we must improve the relationship between the work of the Assembly and that of the other parts of the United Nations system, including the Secretariat. This is needed to maintain the centrality of the General Assembly as envisaged in the Charter. It is also needed to ensure that the total resources of the United Nations system are brought to bear in a harmonized and effective fashion in an effort to resolve international problems. 
The President of the General Assembly not only presides over and represents the General Assembly but has, in my view, the responsibility to bring it and its decisions close to the peoples in those areas where the United Nations is needed most. Early in the new year, the time when our Organization was so deeply concerned with the emergency which had arisen in the Gulf, I visited the camps in the occupied territories and in Jordan. It was important to assure the Palestinian refugees that the world community still cared deeply about their plight both in its political as well as in its social and humanitarian aspects. It was essential to be close in those difficult days to the Commissioner-General and to the United Nations Reli~f and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) in their dedicated service to the Palestinian refugees and in defence of human rights. 

(The President) 
On the way to Jerusalem there is a cemetery where members of the United Nations peace-keeping force who have died in the performance of their duties are buried. 1 stood by, the graves of those soldiers and 1 felt that the General Assembly wos with me. Last Friday in Lebanon another soldier of the United Nations peace-keeping force gave his life while carrying out his duties. To date, over 700 of them have lost their lives in the service of the United Nations. Theirs is a martyrdom in the service of peace. 
In the demilitarized zone between Iraq and Kuwait there are outposts manned by the forces of the United Nations Iraq-Kuwait Observation Mission. The heat was intense when 1 visited the men of different nationalities manning the posts. It is time to consider the quiet dedication which is alr~ady inspired by our Organization and which can so enrich the future of a second-generation United Nations. Reflecting on the unity of purpose guiding the soldiers of peace from diverse parts of the globe, one sees the embryo of those forces which the Charter envisages for the maintenance of peace and security. 
As President of the Assembly, I was in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, on 21 June 1991~ in time to witness the early stages of the resurgence of that troubled country from the strife of civil war. In a visit to the refugees camps of Teferi Ber 1 came face to face with a striking instance of one of the bitterest tragedies of our time - the hunger refugees, with their untold and often apparently irremediable sufferings. 
Here again, in my meetings with United Nations officials from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UllHCR) and other ~rganizations, I experienced another dimension of the personal dedication and commitment which the United Nations has such tremendou"" ~~pacity to generate: the unknown heroes of today, young men and women - including many from diver.se 
non-governmental or~ani.ations - who are dedicating the best years of their lives to the servic:e of those who, for many, may appear to be forgotten by humanity. 
In this contest, I should lite specifically to mention - in this twentieth year of operation, further to a 1970 resolution of the General Assembly - the competence and commitment of the 2,000 United Nations volunteers, specialists and field workers currently serving in more than 100 developing countries. I intend mating a special reference to this ina message to the Third Intergovernmental Meeting OD Volunteers due to take place later this year in Eathmandu. 

It is a sad indictment of our world of savage contrasts between wealth and poverty that the question of refugees, victims of natural as well as man-made disasters, has to figure so prominently in the work of our Organization. I came across another instance of this situation in my own country and in Italy, in August, with thousands of Albanian refugees - refugees not from political circumstances in a country which has with courage taken up the road to democracy, but from a very difficult economic situation. 
Undoubtedly our Organization has the set task of enlarging its already extensive experience and commitment in this field, especially in relation to those who do not fall within the legal definition of refugees under existing international conventions. This is a matter which I have taken up with the Secretary-General as well as with UNHCR. I am most encouraged with their responses as well as with the already expressed intention of many delegations to take up this matter as a priority item during the forthcoming session of the Asse!t'bly. 
The pa,t year ha, been yet another year of major international development, and it va, a qratifyinq opportunity to brinq the As,~lIbly"" pre,ence to bear upon some of the,e important development,. I wa, in Pyongyanq and Seoul ,hortly before the two Korea, applied for membership of our Orqanization. I was also in Kiev durinq the last days of the dramatic events in the Soviet Union in late Auqust. 
A visit to Ukraine brinqs foremost another major qlobal problem of our time - that of a deterioratinq environment. In lootinq at the disaster of Chernobyl, I reflected - as I had ea~lier done amidst the raqinq fires of the Kuwaiti oil fields - upon the huqe tasks that lie before humanity in the effort to save itself from destruction. Chernobyl is an international disaster and, as such, it requires an international approach in its solution. 
The Pledging Conference on Chernobyl, scheduled for 20 September 1991, is a reminder of both international solidarity and international involvement. I am sure that many will be those Member countries which will give tangible evidence of their solidarity. 
The environment problem must be a major item on the international agenda, which awaits the input of a revitalized General Assembly. 
May I share with members, on this my last occasion to address the Assembly as President, a reflection on the Trusteeship Council. It has served, and is still serving, its purpose under the Charter; the fact that we are welcoming into the General Assembly, tomorrow, two countries - Micronesia and the Marshall Islands - through the Trusteeship Council is a reflection of its relevance, but its very success in bringing to nationhood so many countries and peoples previously under trust has diminished its role. May we suggest that, in addition to its role under the Charter, the Trusteeship 
Council should hold in trust for humanity humanity's common heritage and its common concerns: the environment; the protection of extraterritorial zones and of the resources of the sea and of the seabed; the climate; and the right~ of future generations. These we have to hold in trust for humanity, and the Trusteeship Council may be the right organ for this purpose. 
Another dimension of the Assembly's revitalization process lies in an enhanced political input. ! am reminded, in this connection, of the distinction which the Assembly's first President, Paul-Henri Spaak, made in his conclUding speech in 1946. President Spaak said: 
""I went to Geneva a few times before the war, and I had the 
impression of being at a meeting of diplomats. Here I have had the distinct impression of being at a meeting of statesmen. 
""I really do think that we have set up a tentative world 
parliament. I am not quite sure yet that the system is entirely good, but I must admit that the first attempt which we have witnessed here inspires me with confidence."" (Official Re~~r~s of the General Assembly, 67th Plenary Meeting, p. l41~) 
I believe that the work of the Assembly should constitute a blend of political thrust and diplomatic exercise. Over the years, our As~embly has lost its political edge by larqely marginalizing the part played by Ministers to that of welcome - but short-stay - honoured guests whose role it is to deliver speeches before quickly departing. In my consultations, I have explored the possibility of greater ministerial involvement in the work of the General Assembly and of creating the opportunity for a more active role to be played by parliamentarians in the work of the Main Committees, perhaps through a better staggerinq of Assembly meetings over the year. 
There is an important aspect which, in my view, requires the constant attention of the Assembly. I refer to the question of the North-South dialogue. Though we may have moved away, in our efforts at economic development of the third-world countries, from the ""dismal science"" mentality by introducing the ""human face"" dimension, may we perhaps add to this notion the notion of a face which is both human and honest? We still do not have the equivalent of East-West detent~ in the North-South relationship. We think that the General Assembly has to have a major, and a clearer, relationship with the Bretton Woods institutions in order to brinq in that ingredient which has been lacking in past debates and without which hopes of a breakthrough may fade away. 
The maintenance of peace and security ca~ be achieved only at this other, dramatic frontier, the war aqainst want. So lonq as the ""poverty curtain"" is still there, peace and security are at risk. This fact was brouqht home to me with unnervinq immediacy by a team of U~ited Nations field officials from various aqencies durinq my recent visit to Ghana. There I met over a dozen very dedicated and able professionals who spoke to me enthusiastically about the varied work in which they were involved, the difficulties they faced, and the extensive efforts they had to undertake in order to fulfil their tasks. 
Two points which were made to me durinq the meetinq, however, made an impression on me. One was the comment from those attendinq that it was very rare for them to have the opportunity to speak about their work to a senior representative of the General Assembly. The other was the bitter observation by one of the officials that in spite of the efforts that they were puttinq in, both individually and collectively, the work of the aqencies they represented constituted only a minor input into the development efforts needed in the countries where they were operatinq. 
In my openinq statement to the Assembly a year aqo, I underlined the human realities behind the statistics with which we are dealinq, what it means in terms of human sUfferinq when we say that 1.1 billion people live in extreme poverty, that the number of countries considered as least developed amonq develop!nq countries rose from 24 in 1971 to 42 in 1990. Clearly, we have a lonq and difficult road still before us. 
It has been a privil,~qe to serve the Assembly and the United Nations durin~ these last 12 months. It has been an honour for my country, Malta, to preside over the Assembly. The cooperation and help which I have received from the deleqations here and from their Governments in my visits to various countries, listening and learning, were fundamental for a better evaluation of the aim, purposes and future of the Organization. 
I want to thank the Secretary-General for his advice and assistance. His wisdom and his calm diplomacy are an asset to the Organization. I think his stewardship of the United Nations is leaving a hallmark on its future operations. 
To Under-Secretary-General Spiers and his dedicated staff, my thanks for helping me preside over. the Assembly. 
I said that it was a privilege for me to serve the United Nations. It was more than a privilege: it was an experience in the human dimension. When addressing the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, in Moscow a few days ago, this concept of the human dimension reminded me of the genius of Leonardo da Vinci in putting man at the centre of creati~n, reaching out to discover and understand the universe. It is this human dimension, in its universality, which is the commitment of the United Nations. 
The United Nations is a complex organization. The sensitivities of all nations here have to be respected. Realpolitik cannot be ignored. In the economic world miracles do not happen, and in the social field it takes time to heal differences and to bring in new cultures. Yet the United Nations, with all the misgivings and all its mistakes, is fundamental for the cause of progress in the world. It is as powerful and efficient as the member countries want it to be. 
But there is an aspect which remains the cornerstone of the Organization: it is the concept of peace. We have to safeguard peace. We have also learned how to defend peace. But peace itself can be negative if born in the acceptance of a denial of human rights, if misery and hunger are the life sentence to which billions of people are condemned. Pandit Nehru, who spent his life sUffering for freedom and yearning for peace, said: ""Peace is indivisible; so is freadom. So is prosperity now; so also is disaster in this one world that can no longer be split into isolated fragments."" 
For the peace that we are striving for, and for which millions have died, is peace in freedom. This is our commitment in the United Nations. This is our shared privilege. This is our common responsibility.

10260,"Helmut Kohl, Chancellor Inauguration Speech",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-with-chancellor-helmut-kohl-germany-1,Helmut Kohl,Chancellor (Germany),Inauguration Speech,1991,,"The President's News Conference With Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany
May 20, 1991
The President. I had a chance to welcome Chancellor Kohl, the Chancellor of a united Germany. And I was delighted to do that and welcome him and his Foreign Minister, Hans-Dietrich Genscher, and others in his party. We've had a good meeting.

We discussed the European security and the importance of NATO in terms of future security for Europe. We both agreed that we have a lot at stake in the successful conclusion of the Uruguay round. We had detailed discussions about the Soviet Union, and Chancellor Kohl shared with me his thoughts on that important question. And I had a chance to thank Chancellor Kohl for Germany's support during the war and to congratulate him for the leadership role that Germany took in trying to bring aid to the Kurds over there in Iraq.

The Chancellor. Thank you very much, Mr. President. Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to take this opportunity to thank you and all of our American friends for the unrelenting support which we have been given on our way to complete German unification.

For over 40 years our American friends have guaranteed peace and freedom of the free part of our fatherland of what was then the Federal Republic of Germany. Millions of American soldiers have served their military service in our country, far away from their home country. We will never forget that because that was a precondition for the 3d of October, for the Day of German Unity.

Today again we talked about the process of political unity for Europe, as we have done numerous times during our telephone conversations. This is really what we have always wanted: to get the support of our American friends and partners. And I'm very pleased to be able to be part of that process, a process which Winston Churchill talked about already in 1946 in his famous speech in Zurich, a process leading up to what he called then ""the united states of Europe.""

And this process, heading towards political unity, economic unity within Europe, obviously also includes cooperation with the United States of America. German-American friendship and friendship between Europe and the United States is of existential importance for a future for all of us. And this also goes for NATO, which is why it is also important in the future that the United States maintains a substantial troop presence in Germany, but also in Europe as a whole.

Mr. President, we talked about GATT, about the Uruguay round. The two of us know that it would deal a fatal blow to world trade if we would let protectionism come in and take the upper hand. That does not only hold true for us Germans, we, as one of the leading exporting nations in the world. A failure of GATT would also be a catastrophe for the developing countries. This is why we have to work very hard in order to bring about a success for the Uruguay round, for GATT. And although it is a very difficult subject, I think that we have cause to be carefully optimistic and to see -- to state that things are actually moving.

As far as the conflict -- the war in the Gulf is concerned, I would like to mention here once again what I already told the President. We in Germany and we as Europeans, in Europe as a whole, we want to see his initiatives to be successful. We are very grateful for what Jim Baker did, and I hope that he will continue his missions and that this war, which has been won, will lead also to a peace which is won.

The last thing I wanted to mention here has already been, I think, touched upon by the President, and let me say this in one brief sentence. We have a joint interest, and we as Germans have a particular interest, in seeing the reform movements in Central Europe and southeastern Europe and also in the Soviet Union to be successful.

The President. May I suggest that, on the questions, we alternate one to Chancellor and one to me. I'd be glad to start.

Soviet Union

Q. Chancellor, would you like to see President Gorbachev have a role at the London economic summit?

The Chancellor. President Gorbachev is going to play a role irrespective of whether he's actually bodily present or not. And I think that we have to take a break and talk about it in some detail, about what is going to happen at that summit.

Q. Would you support it?

The Chancellor. I would support what is reasonable and what is beneficial to both sides. And one has to weigh carefully the pros and cons, and one has to talk to them personally about this. And let me say that, at this very point here in this press meeting, I'm not yet in a position to have any sort of definitive answer to that, but I'll soon have one.

Q. Mr. President, did the Chancellor ask you to give any increased aid to the Soviet Union? And where do you stand now on the request for $1.5 million in agricultural credits?

The President. No, there was no specific request. I think there was general agreement that we'd like to be able to help the Soviet Union in every way possible. And we both expressed our confidence in President Gorbachev. Still under consideration.

The Chancellor. I would like to underline this -- taking this occasion to underline this, that we both completely agree in that -- that we support Gorbachev here, that we completely agree with that.

U.S. Troops in Europe

Q. Chancellor, why do you want U.S. troops to remain in Europe? And President Bush, do you think they should stay there?

The Chancellor. Because I think that in spite of the fact that the situation has obviously changed and that indisputably the danger has decreased, I still say and I still think that NATO makes sense, albeit in an adjusted form. It will have to develop. But I still think that NATO should remain. It makes sense. And if NATO is there, then it makes sense that the United States maintain a troop presence.

And let me say, I think that this is both in the American and in the European interest.

Q. And, President Bush, your reaction to that?

The President. I agree with it. NATO kept the peace for 40 years, and the U.S. is a significant participant in NATO, obviously. And we don't want to pull back into some sphere of isolation.

Soviet Union

Q. Mr. President, would you pay an invitation to Mr. Gorbachev for the G - 7 meeting in London?

The President. I agree with what the Chancellor said on that same question: that we're waiting and considering, and see what would be most helpful in terms of the economic recovery in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe.

Q. Mr. President, is it now -- --

The President. Can you shoot it to the Chancellor? It's his turn. We're going in turns here. Or forever hold your peace, and I'll get around to it later.

Yugoslavia

Q. Mr. Chancellor, Yugoslavia seems to be falling apart at an accelerating pace. Is there anything that you believe that the United States and the NATO allies can do to try to halt the process from disintegrating into violence? And did you discuss that with the President?

The Chancellor. I think that we can all do something. I don't think that this is something which will fall specifically into the sphere of confidence of NATO. I think the European Community could also do something here and must, indeed, do something here. And Yugoslavia must have a very vested interest in cooperation with the European Community. And I think that we are in total agreement here with our American friends that we must act together here, but that, as it is a very delicate subject, we must also be very prudent, very careful in the way we deal with it. It's, as I said, a very delicate, a very difficult problem which actually goes back centuries.

The President. Now we'll go over here. Yes, sir.

Iraq

Q. Mr. President, is it now your policy not to lift sanctions against Iraq as long as Saddam Hussein remains in power? Is that a hard, fast position?

The President. We will abide by the United Nations resolutions, of course. It is our policy that there will not be normalized relations. And it is my view that only if the sanctions are complied with will we be willing to -- I mean, only if every provision of the United Nations resolutions are complied with would we, the United States, be willing to lift sanctions.

Q. Are there any conditions under which sanctions could be lifted and Saddam Hussein still remain in power?

The President. There are certain areas where Iraq, in order to comply with United Nations sanctions, must sell abroad. They've got funds set up to put some of their oil revenues into it. But all of these things are down the road. At this juncture, my view is we don't want to lift these sanctions as long as Saddam Hussein is in power.

Soviet Union

Q. Mr. Chancellor, you talk about the general support to Gorbachev. Did you discuss any specific measures you can take to help him?

The Chancellor. We are in total agreement about one principle: it can only be help for self-help, because these reforms must actually be carried out in the Soviet Union itself. For example, a restructuring of the overall system there, actually bringing about what we call a federative structure. And this also goes for reforms leading up to the introduction of a market economy.

This is, incidentally, a dramatic process. We, ourselves, have now experiences with the kinds of problems that you incur if you try to achieve that transformation if we look to the so-called new Lander, the Eastern Lander [States] of what is now the Federal Republic of Germany.

Q. Mr. President, was progress made today by the negotiators on resolving the issues around the CFE treaty? And if those issues are resolved, would you be willing to go ahead with a summit in June or July with President Gorbachev?

The President. Are you referring to Mr. Moiseyev's visit?

Q. I am, but I can't say his name.

The President. I'm just getting briefed on it here. The answer is, not much progress. And they've not reported to me on that visit yet. But yes, we get that matter resolved and START resolved, I'd like to have a summit with Mr. Gorbachev.

Iran

Q. Chancellor Kohl, you recently spoke over the telephone with Iranian President Mr. Rafsanjani, and your Foreign Minister was recently in Iran. Did you discuss that subject with the President? Do you feel that Iran is opening to the West -- wants to open to the West? Did you discuss the question of hostages?

The Chancellor. Actually, we touched on this issue very briefly, but we're going to take it up at a later stage. I've actually had a number of telephone calls with President Rafsanjani. Hans-Dietrich Genscher was there and had very interesting discussions with him. And my impression is -- and let me be very careful here -- that after years of abstinence, they seem to be willing to show more of an openness, more of a willingness to actually have contacts and talks with the West, which will be in the common interest, particularly if the preconditions would develop favorably.

A precondition, for example, would be that the American hostages are finally allowed to go home to their families. Let me say to you, I pointed this out very, very clearly in no uncertain terms to him. I told him that's more than just a question of improving the political climate here.

The President. We have time to take one more question each.

Kuwait

Q. Mr. President, we've seen over the weekend trials in Kuwait. What is your assessment and what are your concerns about the nature of Kuwaiti justice right now?

The President. I haven't had a report on the trials themselves yet. And when I read about them, I tried to put myself in the place of the Kuwaiti citizens who were brutalized by Saddam Hussein. I tried to think back, and it wasn't hard, to the brutality and the terrible grief that the families that stayed in Kuwait had. And I can understand that there's a lot of bitterness from those Kuwaitis who saw their country raped and pillaged in an unconscionable way.

Having said that, I think it would be in Kuwait's interest to extend the fair trial to everybody and to be as compassionate as one can given the outrages that they faced.

The last question's for the Chancellor.

Q. Do I take that, sir, as meaning you think they can do a better job?

The President. All I know of the trials is what I read in the paper today, and so I'd want to reserve on that until I understand exactly how the system works.

World Economy

Q. Chancellor Kohl, did President Bush reiterate the American request for lower German interest rates? And what's your position on that question?

The Chancellor. Actually, we did talk about that in passing. But I think that the opinions here are well-known. We as Germans have an interest in seeing sound economic growth worldwide. And we are giving an important contribution to that, not least as a consequence of German unification. As a consequence of German unification, we have seen the German economy emerge -- and I don't like that word all that well -- emerge as a sort of locomotive, as a sort of engine motor of the worldwide economy. And I think that this is of advantage to all of us, which is why I think that discussing what can we do in order to push, in order to promote world economy is going to be a very important subject during the G - 7 meeting in London.

The President. Sarah [Sarah McClendon, McClendon News Service], you missed what I said. I said these were the two last ones. I'm very sorry."

In fact, it would be the quickest way to marginalize the role of the United Nations syates! as a whole. I say this in order to express to all meehars my thanks for the gteat positive response I have bad free the great majority, if not all the membership, in cooperating in maki4 our efforts successful and in supporting the role of the General Assembly under the Charter; I thank the Assembly far resolution 46177 on institutionalising the Office of the President, which the Aassembly approved by conseMus, and for its support for the role aad facilities of the Office of the President of the General Assembly in the performance of his responsibilities. I hope that members will take great care to ensure that the resolution is implemented and that tRe next session will witness that implementii5on and a coannitment to carrying it out on the part of all those concerned. The cooperation mhich members have 50 kindly extended to me in dealing with various affairs of great concern and the results we have achieved in many situations have largely proved then ability of the General Assembly to undertake an overall effort in supportiag , coordinating, and activating the organs of t3.e Wited Nations and its organisations. I must put on record my special appreciation to members when I state that the General Assembly, for the first time in its history, has held meetings in every month of the year except January and June.

May I wish you again, in the n6ne of the entire metiership, which will no doubt give you its fu.\lnst support, all ths 8uccess and 81X the satisfaction of great achievement. 
 
1 now invite Hir Bxcollency Mr. Boutros Ghali to make a statement. ~~Q~,-~ (interpret,ation from Arabic) : lrllow me, at the outset, to extend to you, Mr. President, my moat sincere thanks for the kind words you have addressed to me. I have been deeply touched by your kind thoughts ond good wisher. It wan A source of deep aatiafaction for mo when the Security Council, in its rerrolution 720, unanimously recnmnouded me a6 the sixth Secretary-General of the United Nations. The unanimour adoption by the General Assembly of the resolution endorsAng this recommendation is indeed a great honour for me. On the pareanal level, I am grateful to each member of this august assembly. On the official level, I am equally grateful to every Member State of t.he United Nationa that honoured me with this great truat. I am only too ronscious of the magnitude of this task from this very moment. I do not claim to elevate the vision of the Utopian city called for by the Islamic thinker Al-Parabi to that of a Utopian world, for I cannot promise t.o go beyond what is feasible and what is possible. Despite the close tie8 that bind me to optimism, my tie8 to realism are even closer. In the name of every African, I wish to express appreciation for the opportunity afforded to Africa, through my election, to take part in the service of the international community. Africa feels ready to make its contribution by virtue of its creative ability and recent achievements in the internationai arena. On the other hand based on the premise of equal opportunity for all members of the family of nations and in a spirit that goes beyond mere equality and rises to the level of equity that should permeate the fibre of international relations, a true challenge has been preserrted to Africa.
Needless to may, I see in my election a special appreciation for Egypt and recognition of the role she plays on the international scene. The fact that I belong to Egypt, an Arab African State that borders the Mediterranean Sea, which, throughout the ages has been a crossroads for many cultures and has been the crucible of civilisation and religions, imbuea me with the faith which every Egyptian wholeheartedly embracea, Lhat ia, faith in peace and security a8 a goal, in dialogue and negotiation as an approach and in harmony and cooperation am a hope. It is my fervent desire aa I discharge my duty to communicate this cultural legacy through mutual cooperation and to raise the banner of peace wherever there is underdevelopment, conflict and tension in the world. There are many areas of tension, conClict and confrontation on the international scene, areas where blotId has been shed, where human creativity is destroyed, and where the spirit of cooperation, integration and good neighbourliness faces grave challenges. There are also peoples that are still denied the exercise of their inalienable rights. (woke in E&g&i.&) I should like to underline four basic issues which confront the international community as I see them: First, there is the ueed to ensure the maintenance of international peace and security in conformity with the Charter. This requires the strengthenirg of the United Nations machinery in a manner that will enable it to fulfil its important objectives not only in peace-keeping but in peace-making and itil peace-building as well. In addition to this requirement there is the need For an active preventive diplomacy with a view to monitoring developments of crises and finding adequate mea: s to defuse them and prevent their escalation.
Secondly, thorn ir the aocoruity to atrivo for the attainment of intarnational economic dovolopmont in all its aspects. It ia my intention to addresr thim iraue with vigour in order to contribute to finding ways and meanr to narrow the gap between tho rich North and tho poor South. Teckling the crippling problom of intaraational dobt ir contra1 to achieving a healthy world economy. l!Zqually important, isrues of environmaat and dovelopment must be sariously addrarrad 80 ‘AI to atop any furthor deterioration of our planet. Thirdly, I shall take with utmost roriouaneas my rolo 81 chief administrative officer of this Organisation. It is imperative that the solo criterion to apply in the smploymont of mon sad woman bo the highest standards of efficiency, compstonco and integrity, It is eaid that the United Nations is a mirror image of its Mambor States, and their counsel and support are l rrnential if wo aro to moot tho rtandards they rightfully orpoct. 
I welcome end will carefully rtudy every proposal, from within and without this HOUIJO, for rtreamlining our operationa, eliminating what ia wssteful or obsolete, and ensuring that the mandates entrusted to the Secretary-General are carried out faithfully, accurately and without delay. I come to the poet of Secretary-General inspired by the Charter and full of hope, faith and cormnitmant - conunitment to join with Member States. with the Secretariat and with the ""paople~~ of the United Nations"" in search of intellectual creativity, political imagination and dynamism to help our Organisation meet the challenge of a rapidly changing world. The vision of the Charter of the Un.!ted Nations is a8 valid today, after the end of the cold war, as it was in 1945, before the beginning of the cold war. I call for the cooperatlc: and assistance of all who can help to transform the noble objectives of the Charter into reality.  
fourthly, I wish to stress the United Nations role in strengthening fundamental freedoms and democratic institutions which constitute an essential and indispensable stage in the economic and social development of nations. If there is no development without democracy, there can also be no democracy without development. Although it is difficult. to determine w:,.ether to start with development in order to obtain democracy, or to begin democracy in order to obtain development, it is obvious that the guarantee of fundamental freedoms and the protection of the human rights of both men and women constitutes a prerequisite that the United Nations must promote. That being said, we must not see !lemocracy as a magic potion which will cure all ills. Nor must democracy devour its institutions and degcneraLe into ethnic or tribal conflicts that create a micronntionalism which will hindrr all development, peace and security. 
Finally, Uuitsd Rationo sctivitisr to promoto democracy must not become 6 me&ns of Intervsation in the internal affaira of Wembmr Statea. We have mentioned the role of the United Nation8 in atroagtheninq democratic inatitutionn vithin Mombor Statea. an8 we must allro ntfean the Lxportsnco of Bamocrecy al: tho inter-Stato lovol. The democratisation of international relations ahould camplet* and amplify the democrstiration of national institutions. Thir dual procsra con croato a now dynamic for national peace a-d stability, which ir as important 00 international peace and stability. I should like to conclude thir brief otstoJ,wnt with three comnentsr First of all, I wish to pay tribute to Javier Perez de Cuellar for his admirable achiovemsnta throughout a decade in the service of peace. I OYO him my thanka for the wimr and frstornal advice he has do generously given me and from which I shall continue to benefit. Secondly, I wish to spologizo for not speaking in Chinese, Spanish or Russian in order to relay this message to those who speak these official 1 anquagea . Finally, I wish to say, and to repeat to the int.ernational staff, to the representatives of Member States and to tho heads of the specialized aqoncic-?:. that we shall work together to revitalize the United Nations, that we shall fight togother for pe~cs and security, that together we shall help our wor1ct Organisation to face challenges of the twenty-first century.

10271,"Stoyan Ganev, PGA Closing Speech",http://undocs.org/en/A/47/PV.112,Stoyan Ganev,President of the General Assembly,Inauguration Speech,1992,,"The PRESIDENT: One year ago, I opened the forty-seventh session of the General Assembly of the United Nations with the hope for a better world. Regrettably, the world one year later has not become a better place. Conflicts have arisen one after the other. The number of victims is ever-increasing and most of them are innocent civilians. Virtually daily, the challenges before the United Nations increase; at the same time, the resources of the Organization are limited. The financial difficulties invoke unprecedented measures of selfrestriction. Undoubtedly, the United Nations is facing important decisions. Though the road is not crystal-clear, ""An Agenda for Peace"" contains wonderful ideas and, at the same time, confronts practical problems. The forty-seventh session of the General Assembly recognized its importance both in the general debate and by the adoption of resolutions relating to agenda item 10. Yet, this is barely enough. The time has come for further deep consideration and reconsideration of the role of the United Nations as the world mechanism for peace and development. It is my hope that the next session of the General Assembly will play an essential role in this regard. It is a significant fact that the forty-seventh session directed its attention to preventive diplomacy. From a strategic point of view, this is one of the basic directions of the efforts of the United Nations. If perhaps this had been in the forefront of the deliberations in previous years, some conflicts could have been avoided. Of course, the complexities of the issues are great; none the less, investing in preventive diplomacy is invaluable. I see the future of the United Nations vested in a world mechanism for the prevention of conflicts and wars. This future is not unattainable. In the world today, there truly exist issues that warrant preventive diplomacy, in which the United Nations can play a decisive role. While contemplating the future of the world and trying to seek political solutions, we must not forget about the hundreds and thousands of victims of the wars. No one has the right to dismiss the fact that the United Nations is indeed the hope for saving innocent and suffering people from the ravages of war. I am thinking, for example, about Bosnia, where, if the political will does not prevail in the very near future, those who must endure the coming winter will simply not survive. The political efforts, no matter how great the cost, must not be at the expense of these lives. This is why I strongly appeal to all Member States, their Governments and their political leaders for immediate international humanitarian action for the people of Bosnia, without regard to nationality or religion. I additionally appeal to all sides in the conflict to provide all necessary conditions for this international humanitarian effort. The terms ""revitalization"" and ""restructuring"" now occupy quite a prominent place in United Nations vocabulary. This is hardly surprising, because the Organization is taking a self-critical look in an attempt to adapt to the momentous changes that have occurred in the world over the past several years. The forty-seventh session of the General Assembly witnessed this with the adoption of the resolution under agenda item 31, ""Revitalization of the work of the General Assembly"". It is important that Member States reached a consensus on the reform of the General Assembly and made the first concrete step by restructuring the main Committees. It is my hope that the forty-eighth session will further manifest this revitalization momentum. It would be no exaggeration to say that never before in its history has the Organization been asked to do so much by so many. To be able to meet these challenges, the United Nations must re-evaluate not only its mechanisms and structures, but also its practices, with a view to making itself stronger and more efficient. This can be very well exemplified by so practical a problem as the imposition of sactions, now facing the Organization and its Member States. The irony is that sanctions very often not only exert pressure on the Member States against which they are directed, but also place a huge burden on those complying with them. It would be extremely helpful if the Security Council would come up with a set of measures involving the financial institutions and other entities within the United Nations system that could protect States from such difficulties. In this regard, I should like to emphasize the importance of the resolution just adopted by the General Assembly on agenda item 10. At the end of my mandate, I should like to express my gratitude to all Member States for encouraging and supporting me during my tenure as President of the forty-seventh session of the General Assembly. I should like to express my gratitude to the Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, and to wish him enduring success in the tremendous tasks which lie ahead. I also extend my appreciation to all those from the Secretariat who facilitated my work. I wish to thank you once again, distinguished delegates, for having bestowed upon me the honour of serving as the forty-seventh President of the General Assembly. With the next session, the international community will again renew its expectations for a better world. Hopefully, my successor will have reasons, one year from now, to conclude that the United Nations has succeeded in making the world a better place. I can only say that we sincerely aspire to this goal."
10272,"Bill Clinton, Presidential Inauguration Speech",https://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/clinton1.asp,Bill Clinton,President (United States),Inauguration Speech,1993,,"My fellow citizens :
Today we celebrate the mystery of American renewal.
This ceremony is held in the depth of winter. But, by the words we speak and the faces we show the world, we force the spring. A spring reborn in the world's oldest democracy, that brings forth the vision and courage to reinvent America.
When our founders boldly declared America's independence to the world and our purposes to the Almighty, they knew that America, to endure, would have to change. Not change for change's sake, but change to preserve America's ideals; life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness. Though we march to the music of our time, our mission is timeless. Each generation of Americans must define what it means to be an American.
On behalf of our nation, I salute my predecessor, President Bush, for his half-century of service to America. And I thank the millions of men and women whose steadfastness and sacrifice triumphed over Depression, fascism and Communism.
Today, a generation raised in the shadows of the Cold War assumes new responsibilities in a world warmed by the sunshine of freedom but threatened still by ancient hatreds and new plagues.
Raised in unrivaled prosperity, we inherit an economy that is still the world's strongest, but is weakened by business failures, stagnant wages, increasing inequality, and deep divisions among our people.
When George Washington first took the oath I have just sworn to uphold, news traveled slowly across the land by horseback and across the ocean by boat. Now, the sights and sounds of this ceremony are broadcast instantaneously to billions around the world.
Communications and commerce are global; investment is mobile; technology is almost magical; and ambition for a better life is now universal. We earn our livelihood in peaceful competition with people all across the earth.
Profound and powerful forces are shaking and remaking our world, and the urgent question of our time is whether we can make change our friend and not our enemy.
This new world has already enriched the lives of millions of Americans who are able to compete and win in it. But when most people are working harder for less; when others cannot work at all; when the cost of health care devastates families and threatens to bankrupt many of our enterprises, great and small; when fear of crime robs law-abiding citizens of their freedom; and when millions of poor children cannot even imagine the lives we are calling them to lead, we have not made change our friend.
We know we have to face hard truths and take strong steps. But we have not done so. Instead, we have drifted, and that drifting has eroded our resources, fractured our economy, and shaken our confidence.
Though our challenges are fearsome, so are our strengths. And Americans have ever been a restless, questing, hopeful people. We must bring to our task today the vision and will of those who came before us.
From our revolution, the Civil War, to the Great Depression to the civil rights movement, our people have always mustered the determination to construct from these crises the pillars of our history.
Thomas Jefferson believed that to preserve the very foundations of our nation, we would need dramatic change from time to time. Well, my fellow citizens, this is our time. Let us embrace it.
Our democracy must be not only the envy of the world but the engine of our own renewal. There is nothing wrong with America that cannot be cured by what is right with America.
And so today, we pledge an end to the era of deadlock and drift; a new season of American renewal has begun. To renew America, we must be bold. We must do what no generation has had to do before. We must invest more in our own people, in their jobs, in their future, and at the same time cut our massive debt. And we must do so in a world in which we must compete for every opportunity. It will not be easy; it will require sacrifice. But it can be done, and done fairly, not choosing sacrifice for its own sake, but for our own sake. We must provide for our nation the way a family provides for its children.
Our Founders saw themselves in the light of posterity. We can do no less. Anyone who has ever watched a child's eyes wander into sleep knows what posterity is. Posterity is the world to come; the world for whom we hold our ideals, from whom we have borrowed our planet, and to whom we bear sacred responsibility. We must do what America does best: offer more opportunity to all and demand responsibility from all.
It is time to break the bad habit of expecting something for nothing, from our government or from each other. Let us all take more responsibility, not only for ourselves and our families but for our communities and our country. To renew America, we must revitalize our democracy.
This beautiful capital, like every capital since the dawn of civilization, is often a place of intrigue and calculation. Powerful people maneuver for position and worry endlessly about who is in and who is out, who is up and who is down, forgetting those people whose toil and sweat sends us here and pays our way.
Americans deserve better, and in this city today, there are people who want to do better. And so I say to all of us here, let us resolve to reform our politics, so that power and privilege no longer shout down the voice of the people. Let us put aside personal advantage so that we can feel the pain and see the promise of America. Let us resolve to make our government a place for what Franklin Roosevelt called ""bold, persistent experimentation,"" a government for our tomorrows, not our yesterdays. Let us give this capital back to the people to whom it belongs.
To renew America, we must meet challenges abroad as well at home. There is no longer division between what is foreign and what is domestic; the world economy, the world environment, the world AIDS crisis, the world arms race; they affect us all.
Today, as an old order passes, the new world is more free but less stable. Communism's collapse has called forth old animosities and new dangers. Clearly America must continue to lead the world we did so much to make.
While America rebuilds at home, we will not shrink from the challenges, nor fail to seize the opportunities, of this new world. Together with our friends and allies, we will work to shape change, lest it engulf us.
When our vital interests are challenged, or the will and conscience of the international community is defied, we will act; with peaceful diplomacy when ever possible, with force when necessary. The brave Americans serving our nation today in the Persian Gulf, in Somalia, and wherever else they stand are testament to our resolve.
But our greatest strength is the power of our ideas, which are still new in many lands. Across the world, we see them embraced, and we rejoice. Our hopes, our hearts, our hands, are with those on every continent who are building democracy and freedom. Their cause is America's cause.
The American people have summoned the change we celebrate today. You have raised your voices in an unmistakable chorus. You have cast your votes in historic numbers. And you have changed the face of Congress, the presidency and the political process itself. Yes, you, my fellow Americans have forced the spring. Now, we must do the work the season demands.
To that work I now turn, with all the authority of my office. I ask the Congress to join with me. But no president, no Congress, no government, can undertake this mission alone. My fellow Americans, you, too, must play your part in our renewal. I challenge a new generation of young Americans to a season of service; to act on your idealism by helping troubled children, keeping company with those in need, reconnecting our torn communities. There is so much to be done; enough indeed for millions of others who are still young in spirit to give of themselves in service, too.
In serving, we recognize a simple but powerful truth, we need each other. And we must care for one another. Today, we do more than celebrate America; we rededicate ourselves to the very idea of America.
An idea born in revolution and renewed through two centuries of challenge. An idea tempered by the knowledge that, but for fate we, the fortunate and the unfortunate, might have been each other. An idea ennobled by the faith that our nation can summon from its myriad diversity the deepest measure of unity. An idea infused with the conviction that America's long heroic journey must go forever upward.
And so, my fellow Americans, at the edge of the 21st century, let us begin with energy and hope, with faith and discipline, and let us work until our work is done. The scripture says, ""And let us not be weary in well-doing, for in due season, we shall reap, if we faint not.""
From this joyful mountaintop of celebration, we hear a call to service in the valley. We have heard the trumpets. We have changed the guard. And now, each in our way, and with God's help, we must answer the call.
Thank you, and God bless you all.

10279,"Rudy Insanally, PGA Closing Speech",http://undocs.org/en/A/48/PV.106,Rudy Insanally,President of the General Assembly,Inauguration Speech,1993,,"The President: I should like now, with your indulgence, to offer some concluding remarks at this final meeting of the forty-eighth session of the General Assembly. Comprising 184 nations - the near universality and wide diversity of mankind - this Assembly solemnly undertook to advance through this year the mission for which the United Nations was established: to maintain international peace and security; to develop friendly relations among nations and peoples; and, through multilateral cooperation, to deal effectively with the economic, social and humanitarian issues that affect mankind’s existence on this planet. From the beginning, we approached our work in a constructive spirit and with a forward-looking attitude, which, I am pleased to note, were sustained throughout the year. The resolutions and decisions adopted in this Hall, following patient negotiations in conference rooms and in the corridors, show that with goodwill there are no limits to the possible and that many things for which our peoples have long hoped and prayed for are these days increasingly within our grasp. We realized that the present historical conjuncture offered new opportunities for consensus and progress. Working with a sense of common, indeed global, interests, while avoiding needless confrontation, this session of the Assembly has demonstrated what can be accomplished in the spirit of cooperation. It is not for me to judge if we rose to the measure of events. But certainly even an arbitrary and partial selection of the resolutions and decisions adopted will show that we have worked assiduously towards world peace, towards world development and towards strengthening the capacities of the United Nations to carry out its mission of peace and development. Uppermost in our minds have been the first words of the Charter: ""We the peoples"". Our deliberations invariably transcended national boundaries and dealt directly with people issues: when we considered the worldwide scourge of drug abuse and pledged new support for a global plan of action; when we reviewed the humanitarian work of the Organization and gave it full endorsement; when we examined the universality of human rights and took decisions to translate into practical measures the Declaration of the Vienna Conference, most notably through the establishment of the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights; or when we launched the International Year of the Family. In each of these cases, and many others, the representatives of non-governmental bodies shared our reflections and supported our goals. During this Assembly also, we successfully concluded our negotiations on the law of the sea - without doubt the most important international treaty since the Charter. We also set in motion the International Tribunal for the Prosecution of Persons Responsible for Serious Violations of Humanitarian Law committed in the Territory of the former Yugoslavia since 1991. In this and many other ways, the General Assembly reflected the concern of nations to have a world governed by law, not by force or by terror or by a balance of terror. In our continuing quest for a safe and stable world, regional organizations, which already contribute so much to peacemaking, have now begun to meet together under United Nations auspices to share the lessons of experience which can apply to the Agenda for Peace and help the organization satisfy mankind’s longing to put an end to war. Reflecting the post-cold-war spirit of cooperation, the General Assembly endorsed the decision of the Conference on Disarmament to negotiate a comprehensive nuclear-testban treaty, which we hope in our lifetime can lead to the elimination of these horrific weapons. Let me single out three developments that to my mind clearly illustrate the considerable progress that has been made towards achieving global peace and security. When it adopted its first resolution on 8 October lifting sanctions on South Africa, the Assembly was literally speechless. Later, in a historic session, the Assembly joyously welcomed back this founding Member into its family. The progress of South Africa’s peoples in resolving their conflicts represents the triumph over racism of a spirit of dialogue and consultation. There can be no doubt that the firm stand taken over the years by the General Assembly in applying the principles of the Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights contributed to the amazing changes in that country. The resolutions on the Middle East marked historic developments that few could have anticipated. The General Assembly gave strong political support to the peace process in the region, which, we hope, notwithstanding obstacles still remaining, will proceed steadily forward. And now today, a principled stand has culminated in a breakthrough, which, if sustained, promises the restoration of peace and democracy to the troubled land of Haiti. Such developments as in South Africa, the Middle East and Haiti encourage us to view with hope for peaceful outcomes the otherwise disheartening conflicts and civil wars which persist in Afghanistan, in many States of the former Soviet Union and the former Yugoslavia, and in East, Central and West Africa. The cost of conflict is heavy not only for its immediate victims but also for those who must pay for its resolution. At a time of scarce resources for development, we can ill afford the large cost of humanitarian and other rescue operations which preventive diplomacy and a relatively small investment in a United Nations presence could avoid. (spoke in Spanish) Let me turn now to the area of development. Guided by the Secretary-General’s first report, the Assembly has begun serious consideration of the United Nations role in an Agenda for Development. The broadbased consultations which were held in June last in accordance with resolution 48/166 reaffirmed the mutuality of interest of developed and developing countries. The world hearings, in which both governmental and non-governmental representatives participated, advocated a greater role by the United Nations in the promotion of the Agenda. It was also felt that development was being pursued largely outside the Organization and needed to be returned to its original niche which the Charter provides. In this scheme of things, the Bretton Woods institutions would be brought more directly under the United Nations umbrella for greater coordination of all development efforts. Other agencies might be merged to minimize duplication and overlap of activities and to maximize the use of available funding. Also envisaged by many was the empowerment of the Economic and Social Council to oversee the global economy. These various proposals, which may be considered far-reaching and radical by some, in my view reflect a prevailing dissatisfaction with the present role of the United Nations in development activities as well as a generalized impatience to secure a revitalization of the world economy. Past policies and strategies have obviously failed to show improvement and must now be seriously reconsidered with a view to making much needed progress. (spoke in French) A concerted international effort is clearly required to bring about sustainable world development. The essential dynamic is political will, which has been noticeably lacking thus far. It is therefore devoutly to be hoped that the World Social Summit scheduled to take place in Copenhagen next year will summon the awareness and the commitment that are so urgently required for progress to be made. The three main areas on which the Summit will focus - poverty, unemployment and social integration - are the concern not only of the developing countries but also of the industrialized nations. Poverty is not confined only to the South. Unemployment, the plague of small and poor economies, has become a major problem for the North. In both North and South, the problems of homelessness, disease and all manner of societal degradation have taken root. The time has come when the concepts of interdependence and international cooperation must be translated into practice to combat these evils which threaten our civilization. (spoke in English) May I now say a word on the Assembly’s activities in gearing up the United Nations system to deal with our new circumstances. We found ways this year to resolve an impasse over the relations of the Economic and Social Council with the operating agencies. Here, I remain grateful to our colleague, the Ambassador of Benin, for assisting me in this effort. However, the Assembly’s main exercise has been to become a Committee of the Whole - in effect, to examine all aspects of the role of the Security Council, the body charged by the Charter with special responsibilities for peacemaking and peace-keeping. The Assembly’s decision to create an open-ended Working Group to consider the questions of equitable representation on, an increase in the membership of, and all matters related to the Security Council was a timely initiative to preserve the United Nations efficacy as the custodian of world peace. It was my honour to preside over this important body and, as such, I would venture to say that we have made a good beginning in our search for a more effective, open and representative Council. The views submitted by Member States were so succinct and clear that already one can discern the broad lineaments of what the Security Council might come to look like. I am very grateful to all delegations and to my two dynamic Vice-Chairmen, the Ambassadors of Finland and Singapore, for their contributions, as well as to the efficient Secretariat officials who helped us to advance our work during this session. Quite understandably, it may take some time before these views are transformed into bases of agreement. The fact that all the issues are interlinked will require simultaneous progress on all fronts. Meanwhile, several important steps have been taken to establish better communication between the Council and the Assembly. Such initiatives, I believe, serve to develop a more cooperative relationship between these two organs and bring them into a harmonious balance under the Charter. I come now to the further question of United Nations Secretariat reform and financing. The General Assembly approved a budget for 1994-1995 reflecting much of the restructuring which the Secretary-General deemed necessary to allow the United Nations Secretariat to continue to reinvent itself and to perform more effectively. Later, the Assembly established an Office of Internal Oversight Services and appointed its first Head. These measures, however, do not address the fundamental problem of States’ failing to meet, and on time, the financial obligations they have as Members of the Organization and as signatories to its Charter. The United Nations, it must be reiterated, cannot function effectively unless adequately endowed with human and financial resources to carry out its missions of peace and development. To the extent that assessed budgetary obligations are unfulfilled, this part of the business of the forty-eighth session of the General Assembly remains unfinished. We therefore urge all States to show their commitment by meeting their obligations to the United Nations and to the world. All things considered, the forty-eighth session of the General Assembly has been remarkably active. Not only were the issues on its agenda comprehensive but the pace of its work was greatly intensified. This, in my view, is indicative of the Assembly’s desire to reclaim the patrimony bequeathed to it under the Charter. Now that the constraints of the cold war have been removed, the Assembly is poised to play its proper role in international affairs. The Working Group on the Revitalization of the General Assembly has produced, under the diligent co-chairmanship of the Ambassadors of Sri Lanka and Uganda, a further report. I am pleased to note that the President of the Assembly has been asked to propose, following consultations, ways and means of facilitating an in-depth discussion by the Assembly of matters contained in the reports submitted by the Security Council. This step will certainly involve, and give a greater say to, the Assembly in the vital issues of international peace and security. I do not see why the same cannot apply to the reports of other organs. The role given to the Assembly under the Charter is, in my view, a major one. If justice is to be done to it, the Assembly must continue to examine seriously its methods and procedures to see whether they are both efficient and effective. I therefore urge the Working Group to expedite its consideration of this important matter and quickly devise measures for further improvement. I would personally hope that among these would be one designed to provide adequate resources to the Office of the President. Experience shows that as the activities of the Assembly increase so too will the responsibilities of the presidency. I have been truly privileged to have had the opportunity of serving as President of the Assembly during this most exciting year. Now that I am about to demit office, I wish to reiterate my gratitude for the full support which I have received at all times from my own Government, from the Latin American and Caribbean Group, which did me the great honour of nominating me to the presidency, and, indeed, from all Member States. I am indebted particularly to the Vice-Presidents and the Committee Chairmen, who contributed greatly to the positive outcome of this session. On behalf of the Assembly, I wish to offer a special word of thanks to the Secretary-General and his dedicated staff for facilitating the discharge of our many responsibilities. We remain deeply appreciative of the full and ready cooperation offered by the General Assembly Affairs staff and by our ever-helpful interpreters and other Conference Services personnel. Last, but by no means least, I wish to thank most warmly my own small staff, who performed yeoman service to ensure that the President’s Office worked smoothly at all times. Their faithful efforts cannot be praised enough. Let me conclude on the same note as that on which I began the presidency. At this turning point in human history, the United Nations needs to renew and restructure itself in order to become more responsive to the changing circumstances of the world today. To do so successfully, however, we must - like the authors of the Charter - have a clear vision of the world we want to build for the twenty-first century. As we are reminded by the Book of Proverbs, ""Where there is no vision, the people perish"". (The Holy Bible, Proverbs 29:18) So, too, may the United Nations, unless we give urgent thought to how we enable it to truly become, as was envisaged in its Charter, a centre for harmonizing the actions of Member States to achieve their common ends."
10280,"Helmut Kohl, Chancellor Inauguration Speech",http://www.assembly.coe.int/nw/xml/Speeches/Speech-XML2HTML-EN.asp?SpeechID=120,Helmut Kohl,Chancellor (Germany),Inauguration Speech,1994,,"Mr President, Mr Secretary General, ladies and gentlemen – or permit me, as someone who has been a parliamentarian for more than thirty years, to say dear colleagues. First of all, I should like to thank you, Mr President, very warmly for your kind words of welcome and for the cordial personal remarks in your speech. I am particularly pleased that you have welcomed me in my mother tongue, which gives me the hope that this may become a little more common practice in this Chamber.

The Parliamentary Assembly has never been just an advisory body, but has always seen itself, too, as one of the driving forces behind development of the Council of Europe and indeed Europe itself.

Our continent – we all feel this, and the presence of so many guests and representatives here today reflects the fact – is going through a dramatic phase of change and upheaval. We can also see that in this Chamber. Two years ago, the Council of Europe had twenty-seven member countries. It now has thirty-six and, counting guest delegations, freely elected representatives from a total of forty-two European countries are gathered here today.

It is only by stopping for a moment, considering what things are like in 1995 and then thinking back fifty years that we can measure the enormous distance we have covered in Europe in those decades. I say this in defiance of that foolish and modish pessimism which some people use to further their own political ends.

Looking at developments in Europe in the last fifty years, we can justly afford to feel optimistic. This is why I extend a particularly warm welcome to all the parliamentarians who have come here from central, south-eastern and eastern Europe. Your presence here is convincing proof of what I have just been saying. We have made considerable progress in the last fifty years and, if we have the intelligence, the patience and the courage – three things which belong together – to keep this up in the coming years and decades, there is every reason to hope that, after the twentieth century, which has seen so much in the way of distress, horror and suffering, the twenty-first century may yet turn out well.

The unnatural division of Europe and the unnatural division of Germany have been overcome. In a few days, on 3 October, we shall be celebrating the fifth anniversary of German unification. For us Germans it was a present given us by history, and we are grateful that it was possible for us to receive this present with the approval of all our neighbours.

Everything that is now happening and must happen in my country requires a great deal of energy, courage and mutual understanding, for forty years of division are more than just the result of a mathematical calculation. There was the wall between us and the fact that we belonged to separate political blocs. The experiences of this period of division have become etched on people’s hearts and minds.

Nevertheless, those of you who have visited Germany, including the new Lander, in the last few years will have been aware of the radical changes that are taking place and realised that, in spite of all the worries we naturally have, we are on the right path, although a great deal remains to be done. I am quite sure that the people in Germany will solve together the enormous economic and social problems they face. The most difficult of these problems are not those of a material nature, which we shall solve, though not all at the same time – some will take years. The most important thing, in spite of forty years of separation, is for us to come together again as human beings and, as I say back home, for us to talk to one another and not about one another.

Ladies and gentlemen, the Council of Europe is the oldest pan-European organisation of free states in Europe. It is – and I feel that this cannot be sufficiently repeated – an Institution which embodies like no other the unity of Europe based on respect for human rights, to which Pope John Paul II referred in his speech to the European Parliament as the “genius of Europe”.

In the decades following the end of the second world war, the Council of Europe was already playing an enormous part in drawing our continent together. In 1949 and the years after that, its founders – and we should think of them with gratitude more frequently – tried, often on the basis of their own agonising experiences, to learn the necessary lessons from the history of this century.

They clearly recognised that lasting peace and reconciliation in Europe could be secured only on the basis of democracy and respect for human rights. It is this spirit, this insight and vision of the world, which has determined the Council’s work ever since.

I can only congratulate you on the way in which you continue to apply these principles in admitting new members. Your recommendations to the Committee of Ministers are the basis of its decisions on allowing new countries to join. It must also be said that individual members of the Assembly have done much, in the course of contacts and discussions in applicant countries, to promote democratic structures and further the cause of reform. That, too, is one of the ways in which the Assembly has lived up to its great responsibilities.

It has sometimes been said – and I fully agree with this – that the Parliamentary Assembly is Europe’s “democratic conscience”. You have never shied away from difficult issues – and I hope that we shall be tackling some difficult issues later – from maintaining the Council’s high standards and from making yourselves heard whenever those standards are breached. I would strongly encourage you to keep on doing this in future. You stand for values without which Europe can have no free future.

I have good reasons for mentioning the Council’s work on improving the protection of minorities. I should like, above all, to pay tribute to the framework convention which seeks, for the first time, to protect minority rights and freedoms effectively in international law.

Ladies and gentlemen, I spoke just now about this century, which will be coming to an end in five years’ time. If we stop for a moment and consider what course this century would have taken if we had had declarations that are binding in international law as early as 1910 we realise that we and the peoples of Europe would have been spared terrible suffering.

You have only to watch the reports from the former Yugoslavia on the evening news to see once again how vital it is that Europeans should stop merely talking about the rules embodied in the European Convention on Human Rights and the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities, and at last start applying them.

The important thing now – and I am saying this as German head of government – is also to strengthen the Council of Europe for the tasks that lie ahead. I am thinking here of the European Convention on Human Rights, better protection for minorities and – jointly with the European Union – resolute words and action to combat racist, anti-Semitic and xenophobic tendencies.

Ladies and gentlemen, for our partner countries in central, south-eastern and eastern Europe, membership of the Council of Europe is an important step towards full integration within the European community of values and – I say this advisedly – rights. In this connection I welcome your recommendations in favour of the accession of Macedonia and Ukraine.

It also needs to be clearly pointed out that one of the great challenges of the years ahead will be getting Russia, too, to see its future in European terms – politically, economically, in matters of security and, last but not least, culturally.

Decades of conflict between East and West have made many people here in Europe forget that Russia is part of Europe, not only geographically but in an historical and cultural sense. This is why I particularly welcome your decision to put consideration of Russia’s accession back on the Council’s agenda.

I wish to add here, to make my personal standpoint absolutely clear, that I hope we shall soon 'take a positive decision. We must make it our business – and I say this again as German Chancellor – to support all those in Russia who want and are working to secure the reforms needed to turn their country into a state ruled by law and into a free democracy. Moreover – and this needs to be said here too – the Council of Europe in particular has also worked with non-European countries in the past that respect and are committed to the principles of this Organisation.

For this reason I wish to make a second point here and hope to be able to discuss it with you later: I strongly recommend that we all of us here, in the Council of Europe, look together at ways of forging closer ties with non-European countries, and particularly the United States of America.

Thinking of the ninety-five years we have behind us and the few we have left before this century ends, I cannot believe that it would be wise to make the trans-Atlantic bridge narrower. We should, I believe, make it as broad as we can – from the point of view of economic issues, the environment, security policy, cultural matters and scientific co-operation.

Ladies and gentlemen, right from the beginning the Council of Europe has also seen as one of its tasks the need to keep alive and cultivate an awareness of Europe’s cultural unity. Because of unemployment and, in many cases, mass unemployment, social deprivation and hunger in many parts of the world, one of the most important issues for many people is, of course, an economic one, namely the need to have a job and earn their daily bread. This also applies especially in connection with the ecological challenges we face.

We must not allow the treasures of nature, the gifts of God’s Creation, to be ruined in our generation. At the same time, I should like to warn against our losing sight in our everyday activities – in our necessary concern to earn a living – of the cultural dimension of our own existence, the existence of our peoples and our continent.

This century in particular, with its long roll-call of disasters, has shown us – and we Germans have been taught this by our own history – that a common culture will remain the bond which holds Europe together.

I should therefore like expressly to encourage you in your discussions – and I say this on a day on which you are debating the problems facing OECD – not to lose sight of the cultural dimension of our continent. We should not forget that we come to realise every day that man does not live on bread alone and that the most important and most precious experiences in our private lives have a great deal to do with our cultural environment.

Our aim here must be to achieve pan-European co-operation in important fields, such as school and university education, exchanges in the visual arts and the preservation of our cultural heritage. These sound like very lofty aims, and I should be quite satisfied if, as far as the universities are concerned, we could at least set ourselves the goal of restoring the situation that prevailed in 1910. Yes, you heard right: in 1910 one was able to begin one’s studies at Heidelberg, my own university, and then continue at the Sorbonne and in Oxford. And, if one had the necessary money, one could then also carry on studying at Harvard. At that time all the exams one passed were recognised without any need to sit more.

There were no international treaties on the subject and there were no complicated relationships, such as those between the federation and the Lander in Germany and between the Federal Government and other European states. There were no commission meetings but simply mutual trust among the universities and the moral and educational duty to help young people.

If we translate part of the attitude that prevailed at that time into reality today we can at least say to the generation of 1910 that we are just as good now as you were then. This would be an enormous step forward.

Europe’s cultural identity is, of course, reflected in the diversity of its languages. You would naturally expect the German Chancellor at least to say a sentence or two on this subject. Those who do not have the wrong picture of this Chancellor.

We have two official languages here, and I think it is also time for those who find it difficult to accept to realise that the desire to give German parity at the Council of Europe is not just any wish but a very important one that we Germans are expressing here.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today no part of what will be important for the future of coming generations can be achieved by one state alone by applying the old-style thinking of the nation-state, nor will it be achieved tomorrow and, even less, the day after tomorrow.

This is the historical experience of an entire century. If you look at all the great challenges facing us – unemployment, safeguarding Europe’s economic position in a situation of increasing international competition, for example in Asia and other continents, improvements in environmental protection – I much prefer to say the preservation of God’s Creation – combating cross-border crime, a challenge that is greater than many people understand and has become one of the biggest dangers confronting our continent – then you realise that we are forced to work together.

Much of this was said as long ago as 1949 and was mentioned in the Statute of the Council of Europe. Honesty requires us, in my opinion, to repeat that the dreamers of yesterday have proved to be the realists of today and that he who dreams of Europe need not worry about being called a dreamer, because history will prove him right.

Ladies and gentlemen, without the Council of Europe – this needs to be said in this Chamber, since the Council is not alone in using it – the European Community, now the European Union, could not have been established.

The European Union’s Intergovernmental Conference will be starting next year. Under the Italian and Irish presidencies, it will run through the rest of 1996 and will then, I very much hope, conclude under the Dutch presidency in the first half of 1997.

The moment of truth has now come, and many of the things that are still vague must be made definite.

We now have a choice between building the European home and failing in the eyes of history.

I do not believe that the chances we now have, in spite of all the difficulties, will return in the foreseeable future. We know from the philosophy of history that historical phases are often divided into three: one phase in which events develop, a short phase in which decisions are taken – which often goes unnoticed by the peoples concerned – and a long phase in which peoples experience or suffer from the consequences of these decisions.

I am firmly convinced that we are now in the short decision-making phase. Today – five years before the turn of the millennium – the necessary decisions must be taken. The success of the intergovernmental conference depends, amongst other things, on our having the idea of a common Europe, an awareness of the unity of Europe, a European identity.

When I speak about a European identity I do not mean something that contrasts with our national identity. It is one of the great misunderstandings to believe one can give up one’s national identity in order to take on a European one. Both belong together.

Germany remains my fatherland, and Europe is my future. There is no contradiction in this. It is complementary to the historical thinking of our time. This is why the great European debate now taking place is primarily about these core concepts.

I should like to see a good deal of intellectual openness, in accordance with European traditions, and not the narrow-minded attitudes one unfortunately often encounters.

We also want close partnerships with the neighbouring regions in eastern, south-eastern and southern Europe, because our future also depends on their economic and political stability. The European Union has concluded or drawn up agreements with our partners in central, south-eastern and eastern Europe, especially with those states that have the prospect of joining and wish to do so.

There must not be anything automatic about this process: the countries and peoples concerned must themselves wish to join. However, we must not turn the European Union into a European fortress either. More than anything else, the countries themselves must decide about their future. The policy of reform is also a policy of joining Europe and there must not be any short-cuts.

We want a wider pan-European security system. We want to expand Nato eastwards and, at the same time, establish a sound, unambiguous security partnership with Russia and Ukraine that is acceptable for all parties, for we do not want to erect any new walls in the area of military security either.

Nearly five years ago, we adopted the Charter of Paris. I am concerned that we are still unable to implement its principles throughout Europe. There are still ethnic and religious hatred and the persecution of ethnic and religious minorities.

The terrible images of suffering and death that reach us daily from the former Yugoslavia are not simply pictures of one of the greatest tragedies of the present time. They are also a warning and reminder that it is only by uniting Europe that we can avoid relapsing into barbarism in the twenty-first century.

There are many reasons for building the European home, but the most important thing for me is that we Europeans should live together in peace and freedom in the twenty-first- century and never fall back into that barbaric era which we have left behind us.

This also means that Europe needs the spirit of dialogue and the chance to engage in that dialogue across denominational and religious borders today more than ever before. Our aim must be to build an ecumenical bridge, in the broadest sense of the word, from the monasteries and convents of Ireland to the churches and cathedrals of Kyev and Moscow. We must preserve the positive aspects of our European heritage, the product of hundreds of years of development. I do not only mean Europe’s great masterpieces of literature, music or painting, nor its unique architectural monuments. I am referring in particular to the spirit, the cultural inspiration, that gave shape to these epochs and these works of art, lending the latter a timeless magnificence and beauty that transcends national borders.

In this spirit, classical philosophy and Humanism, the rational thinking of the Age of Enlightenment and Christianity, with its profound formative influence, all flow together. This, ladies and gentlemen, constitutes our common origin; it has shaped our awareness as Europeans. The idea of European unity can be neither understood nor implemented in the future without the system of values that we all have in common, a system based on the uniqueness of the human being, on respect for life, on respect for human dignity and on individual rights and freedoms.

In western Europe we have lived in peace for fifty years. For us Germans this is the longest period of peace in our recent history. Konrad Adenauer’s wish, which he expressed in the first statement of his government’s policies in 1949, that we might live in peace and friendship with all our neighbours, has come true.

The ceremonies in May this year marking the 50th anniversary of the end of the second world war made it clear that we must not forget and bury our history. We must be capable of learning from it. In this spirit and with this awareness, we must direct our thoughts and actions to the future of a united and peaceful Europe. Then we shall be armed against any relapse into past ways.

I say this as a warning to us all: the spectres of chauvinism and fundamentalism are not to be found only in the Balkans or across the Mediterranean. If we want to preserve peace and freedom we must make the process leading to a united Europe irreversible.

We need a weatherproof European house with a strong roof that can accommodate all European peoples according to their needs, and I hope that our American friends can have a permanent right of residence in this house. We want the political integration of Europe; we do not want a kind of advanced free- trade zone of the kind some people doubtless have in mind.

However, anyone who is aware of history, especially economic history, knows that no continent can be kept together with a common currency alone. This Europe needs a political roof and practical solidarity, even at times when an unfavourable wind is blowing.

People keep saying that European unity is not making any progress and that, indeed, Europeans are sceptical and tired. I hear this every day. If people are looking for a lesson in faint-heartedness and a lack of willingness to shape the future they occupy themselves with European matters. Anyone who has spent a long time on European committees, from nine in the morning until two the next morning, may have sufficient grounds for despair.

At the end of the war I was fifteen years old. This was fifty years ago. I experienced a declaration of belief in Europe – I have already said this in this Assembly – for the first time as a 17-year-old not far from here on the Alsace-Palatinate border. As a group of grammar school pupils from Alsace and the Palatinate, we pulled out posts marking the border and sang European songs. We were all certain that “Europe” had arrived. It was still a long way off. The posts were rammed back in and we were chased back across the border.

Today, for our children’s generation “Europe” is more or less taken for granted. If you go to the Charles Bridge in Prague in the summer or the Eiffel Tower in Paris, Piccadilly Circus in London, the Spanish Steps in Rome or the Rhine valley in Germany you will meet thousands of young people from all over Europe – and I say this as a warning to us and to my generation – who are far ahead of us in their thinking and with their hopes, their feelings and, I believe, their actions.

It is true that the peoples of our continent are very different, but it is precisely this diversity that gives us a fantastic opportunity. We do not want a monochrome Europe; we want the whole range of colours our continent has to offer. Europe’s hallmark must be – diversity, not uniformity. We benefit both in our every day political activities and culturally from the conflict between uniformity and living diversity.

Ladies and gentlemen, I hope that we can go into this European future together. It is worthwhile working for this objective; it is, not least, also worthwhile if you consider the young people in Europe. It is their future that is at stake. This is all about the young generation we see growing up in Europe who – and I say this as a German whose family has lost a son in every war – for the first time ever has the chance not to have to go to war and to be able to live in peace and freedom in the twenty-first century.

If we face up to this challenge there will be no reason for anyone to be faint-hearted. This Assembly, too, will also have its important role to play tomorrow and in the future. I wish you and us every success in this venture."
10287,"Amara Essy, PGA Closing Speech",http://undocs.org/en/A/49/PV.108,Amara Essy,President of the General Assembly,Inauguration Speech,1994,,"The President (interpretation from French): As we come to the end of the forty-ninth session of the General Assembly, I am moved by two emotions. The first — why not admit it? — is one of pride: the pride of having embodied, in my humble person, so prestigious an institution, in which peoples continue to place their greatest hopes. I have had the opportunity to accept invitations to visit many Member States, and on each of my journeys I was able to confirm the prominent place our Organization holds, not only for political leaders, but also in the concerns of national opinion. I was able to see that the purposes and principles of our Organization continue to be the supreme reference points that they were at the end of the Second World War. Wherever I went — in America, Asia, Europe and at home in Africa — I was able to assess the scope, the currency and the solidity of the founding act of 1945. Through the expressions of sympathy, friendship or even affection that were extended to me, I was always fully aware that what was being honoured, first and foremost, was the Organization on whose behalf I spoke. This attention has even assumed a special meaning this year as we commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations. I can bear solemn witness to the fact that, half a century after the creation of the United Nations, faith in its ideals remains steadfast. This faith has triumphed over all the many tribulations, crises and bloody conflicts experienced by our planet. Peace, social progress, international cooperation, respect for human rights, set down in letters of gold in the United Nations Charter, remain today the governing words of international relations. I should like to add that, through me, it was the General Assembly — what it represents and symbolizes — that was being hailed. The diversity and richness of the “peoples of the United Nations” set the tone for our Assembly. It is hardly surprising that, throughout these past 50 years, it has been the strongest bulwark of our Organization and that it has been able, at the most trying moments, to preserve a space for dialogue, without which world peace would certainly have been at greater risk. I have already had the opportunity to discuss the invaluable role played by the General Assembly: it has always been at the crossroads of history, and its tireless action, taken with the hopes of peoples in mind, has allowed it to lend greater weight to the very concept of an international community. In this period when uncertainty is vying with anxiety, when pernicious destabilizing factors are as numerous as they are pernicious, when doubts sometimes arise about the capacity of the United Nations to lay the foundations of a new international society, the General Assembly is once again in the spotlight. We must therefore live up to what is expected of us. This leads me to share with the Assembly the second emotion I am experiencing at the end of this forty-ninth session. I must confess to being torn between the certainty that we did our best to carry out the mission conferred upon us and the regret that we were not always able to find solutions to questions affecting both our Organization and the future of the international community. If problems as crucial as those of the reform of the Security Council and the financial situation of the Organization — to mention only two — remain unsolved, it is not for lack of effort on our part. But let there be no misunderstanding: the United Nations will not be able to meet the challenges facing our planet if its structural and financial means do not become better adapted to its fundamental missions. Peace-keeping — and for the moment I shall limit myself to that topic — cannot but seem incomplete if we do not tackle the causes of war. Where poverty takes hold, where frustrations and exclusions accumulate, there is a great likelihood that hatred, which fuels conflicts, will emerge. After those preliminary comments, I should like to share very bluntly with the Assembly some of my thoughts on the present session, which is now concluding. First of all, I can say with certainty that the United Nations is more central than ever to international relations. The general debate at the forty-ninth session once again gave the representatives of Member States the opportunity to express their views on the key topics of our time. While stating their positions — sometimes divergent — on major issues, 45 Heads of State and Government clearly reaffirmed their confidence in the Organization. More than ever the General Assembly is serving as a forum for global discussion, in terms of the number and position of those who address it, on the one hand, and the diversity of the topics considered, or even the range of the 328 resolutions adopted during the forty-ninth session, on the other hand. During this past session, the universality of the Organization was further enhanced with the admission, as the 185th Member State of the United Nations, of the Republic of Palau, the last Trust Territory established by the Charter in 1945. I see this event as an illustration of the role played by the General Assembly in the emancipation of peoples, in accordance with their right to self-determination. I will not give an exhaustive account of our activities. I will mention only a few of them that bear out the standard-setting mandate that has also been conferred on us. At its forty-ninth session, the General Assembly adopted three instruments of major legal and political importance: the Declaration on the Enhancement of Cooperation between the United Nations and Regional Arrangements or Agencies in the Maintenance of International Peace and Security; the Declaration on Measures to Eliminate International Terrorism; and the Convention on the Safety of United Nations and Associated Personnel. Our work was also marked by the entry into force, on 16 November 1994, of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and the Agreement of 28 July 1994 on the implementation of Part IX of that Convention. In May 1995, the General Assembly elected the judges of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Prosecution of Persons Responsible for Genocide and Other Serious Violations of International Humanitarian Law Committed in the Territory of Rwanda and Rwandan Citizens Responsible for Genocide and Other Such Violations Committed in the Territory of Neighbouring States between 1 January and 31 December 1994. During the forty-ninth session, I endeavoured to echo the concerns of Member States in seeking the greatest effectiveness of the Organization. In that spirit, in addition to the existing Working Group on the increase in the membership of the Security Council, three new Working Groups were established with mandates to consider, respectively, the financial situation of the Organization; development problems within the framework of the Agenda for Development; and enhancement of the global effectiveness of the United Nations system. These are basic questions, and the responses they receive will determine to a great extent whether the United Nations achieves its goals for the twenty-first century. An Open-ended Working Group set up during the forty-eighth session took up the question of restructuring the Security Council. That Group, entrusted with examining the question of equitable representation on and increase in the membership of the Security Council, organized its work around two clusters of items: on the one hand, those relating to the composition of the Council, including permanent members, non-permanent members and new categories of members; and, on the other hand, those relating to enhancing the working methods, procedures, effectiveness and productivity of the Council, and its relationship with other United Nations organs. Substantive discussions were held during the present session, but the questions taken up are so complex that we must continue to consider them if we are to achieve significant results. However, though we are far from full agreement, we now have a better idea of the various positions on key areas of these questions. In any event, I believe that we will eventually need political will on the highest level if we are to be successful in this undertaking. Along these lines, the Informal Open-ended Working Group on An Agenda for Peace continued its consultations within the context of the four specific sub-groups. Detailed discussions took place within each of these sub-groups and will continue during the next session. With respect to the Organization’s precarious financial situation, to which the Secretary-General drew the General Assembly’s attention in his statement dated 12 October 1994, a High-level Open-ended Working Group was set up. I had the honour of presiding over this Group, whose work was guided by the desire to ensure a better financial foundation for the Organization. The measures recommended by the Group, as well as the report of the Ad Hoc Intergovernmental Working Group on the Implementation of the Principle of the Capacity to Pay as the fundamental criterion in determining the scale of assessments for contributions to the regular budget, were submitted to the General Assembly. Since agreement was not reached on many points, the Assembly requested the Working Group to continue its work during the fiftieth session. With respect more particularly to the need to improve the management of peace-keeping operations, the General Assembly adopted a set of procedures aimed at rationalizing the administrative and budgetary aspects of the financing of the United Nations peace-keeping operations. The General Assembly also continued its consultations on the Agenda for Development. In this connection, an ad hoc open-ended working group was established to formulate proposals that might lead to the final adoption of an action-oriented Agenda for Development. The Working Group made considerable progress, but owing to time constraints was unable to complete its work. That Group also will continue its work during the fiftieth session. Finally, the General Assembly has just set up a highlevel open-ended working group on the strengthening of the United Nations system, whose recommendations will help to enhance the global effectiveness of the Organization. Generally speaking, our expectations are such that any difficulties experienced by the United Nations lead to deep disappointment, commensurate with the hopes that have been dashed. And then the Organization is accused not of doing too much, as it has been in the past, but rather of not doing enough. This tendency to question the United Nations and to have such high expectations of it is certainly a reflection of the changing global environment. The General Assembly, for instance, which in the past met only on rare occasions between January and September, is now in almost permanent session throughout the year. Over the past nine months I have presided over, in addition to the meetings of the General Assembly, the work of three working groups — I was of course, supported effectively by the Vice-Presidents — and I undertook consultations for the establishment of a fourth working group. I also made many official visits at the invitation of Governments of Member States. As can be seen, the presidency of the General Assembly now involves many activities, both at and away from Headquarters. In this respect, it is appropriate to recall General Assembly resolution 46/77 on the institutionalization of the Office of the President of the General Assembly and the support provided to that Office in the carrying out of the President’s mandate. In order for the President of the General Assembly to carry out all these activities, it is essential that this resolution be implemented and that predictable and appropriate budgetary resources be released for that purpose. It is high time the General Assembly considered this question. The second thought I wanted to share with the Assembly relates to the need for the renewal of the United Nations. This need is indisputably linked to the new political conditions that in recent years have made it possible for the Security Council to exercise with greater determination than ever its own peace-keeping responsibilities. From 1989-1990 on, the United Nations has made a major commitment to peace-keeping operations and to the establishment of legal, political, economic and social structures for securing peace. The action of the Security Council, the permanent body of limited membership that acts on behalf of all the States Members of the Organization, has become essential. However, that action must take account of the great diversity of the international community and adapt itself accordingly, because nothing could be more dangerous than the sense that the institution bearing primary responsibility for peace-keeping acts only as an instrument in the service of certain Powers. No one denies that the Council has exceptional decision-making powers or that it imposes sanctions. However, Security Council action would benefit from enjoying the broadest possible consensus if partiality is to be avoided. It would not be desirable for the institutional imbalance between the Security Council and the General Assembly of the United Nations to be exacerbated. Such an imbalance would reflect an erroneous interpretation of the Charter, which, while opting for efficiency in the field of peace-keeping, has relinquished none of the competences of the General Assembly, an institution embodying the principle of the sovereign equality of the States Members of the Organization. I have also reflected on the question of international peace and security. Undeniably, the indefinite extension of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons must be noted as a major achievement in assuring international security. We are aware of the decisive role played by the General Assembly in bringing about that agreement, which was concluded on 11 May 1995 in New York. With respect to hotbeds of tension in general, when the Security Council was paralysed by the use of the veto we observed the General Assembly’s vigorous use of its powers emanating from the Charter, in particular Article 11. On many occasions it was involved in peace-keeping activities. Even if the world political situation is different from that which prevailed a few years ago, the General Assembly cannot be excluded from questions having to do with international peace and security. In this field, the work of our Organization must be preventive in nature, an issue that was very close to the heart of former SecretaryGeneral Dag Hammarskjöld. Preventive diplomacy is one of the fundamental bases of the policy defined by the present Secretary-General in his “An Agenda for Peace”. In this context, the General Assembly must have a greater role, and it is desirable that the recommendations of the Assembly’s Informal Open-ended Working Group on An Agenda for Peace contribute to the preparation of resolutions for the strengthening of peace. By reason of its universal composition and the range of viewpoints expressed in it, the General Assembly is the organ in the best position to fulfil the function of conflict prevention. From this standpoint, and without any prejudice to the competences of the Security Council, the Assembly must remain at the heart of the peace-keeping system as an organ for deliberation and prevention. There is another sphere in which the role of the Assembly is essential, namely that of fact-finding, which is so important in the quest for solutions or conflict prevention. Here, again, the work of the Assembly can reinforce and complement that of the Security Council with a view to greater effectiveness. I have also considered the problems of the financing of the Organization and of its actions for peace. As we all know, this question is vital for the future of the Organization and therefore to the maintenance of peace. The financial situation of the United Nations is one of grave crisis. The Secretary-General addressed the General Assembly on this subject on 12 October 1994, but he had also sounded the alarm on the financial picture on 22 June, before the High-level Open-ended Working Group on the Financial Situation of the Organization. The crisis is due, above all, to the fact that Member States do not pay in full and on time their financial contributions to the various budgets of the Organization. As of 10 August 1995, the unpaid balance of contributions amounted to $3.9 billion, of which $858.2 million corresponded to the regular budget and $3 billion to the budget for peace-keeping operations. Obviously, this situation affects the functioning and the effectiveness of the United Nations in all fields, especially that of peacekeeping. In the course of this session the General Assembly has reaffirmed the need to comply with Article 17 of the Charter, under which the financing of peace-keeping operations is the collective responsibility of all Member States. In “An Agenda for Peace”, the Secretary-General made some proposals concerning this issue, and some of them have been adopted by the General Assembly and implemented. What is really called for is that we should reflect on the matter together. More than ever before, the General Assembly must take the initiatives required in such a situation in order to free the Organization from the financial uncertainties now affecting it and to free it also from the control exercised in this area by certain Member States. In this regard, the boldest of measures should be envisaged to provide the Organization with appropriate and predictable resources. These solutions must in any event take into account the capacity of Member States to pay. The relationship between the United Nations and the regional organizations was of particular interest to me. This seems to me to be one of the most important questions for the future of international relations. The maintenance of peace calls for the implementation of the provisions of Chapter VIII of the Charter. The Security Council attaches great importance to the role of regional arrangements and organizations, and it considers it indispensable that their efforts be coordinated with those of the United Nations. In its resolution 47/71 (para. 52) the General Assembly expressly encouraged regional and subregional organizations to cooperate with the United Nations, in accordance with Chapter VIII of the Charter. The role of the General Assembly is therefore vital. Because of its universal composition, it is the venue par excellence for debating problems of regional security with a view to seeking viable solutions aimed at the establishment of lasting regional peace, which is a prerequisite for any form of development. I have also reflected on the relationship between the United Nations and world public opinion, and I have arrived at the conviction that the General Assembly must be the interpreter of international public opinion. For 50 years now, the General Assembly has been echoing international public opinion by contributing, through its many resolutions and conventions, to a significant evolution of positive international law. The role of the General Assembly has also contributed to the international community’s heightened awareness of problems related to economic and social development. One major innovation of the General Assembly along these lines is the holding of large world conferences. These conferences make it possible for broader debate to take place, and they generate concrete programmes of action. Dealing with issues from human rights in general to the specific situation of women, from sustainable development to the prevention of natural disasters, from population problems to those of the environment and from habitats to social development, they endeavour to reflect mankind’s aspirations for greater well-being. The participation of non-governmental organizations in these conferences and the ever greater mobilization of public opinion to which they lead are to be commended. We welcome the considerable progress achieved at Beijing on the long road towards the advancement of women. I want again to stress the decisive role of the General Assembly in all these conferences. I turn now to my own continent, Africa. At its substantive session, held at Geneva this summer, the Economic and Social Council focused its high-level debate on the development of Africa. It recalled the relevance and timeliness of the United Nations New Agenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s, along with the necessary framework of partnership between Africa and the international community, within which the objectives of the New Agenda should be attained. Unfortunately, we must note that, in the context of a globalized economy, Africa, despite courageous reform and considerable national efforts at adjustment, remains a marginalized continent with no real share in the overall growth of the world economy. Indeed, the simplified image of Africa too often seen in the international media does not reflect the revolution — let us not be afraid of a word — in which Africa is engaged. In the face of growing economic and social difficulties, our States are resolutely undertaking reforms aimed at improving our economies and at restoring basic economic balance. We are also promoting the State of law and the rules of democracy. The success of such undertakings depends on the support of our peoples. No reform whatsoever can succeed without the prior consent of the peoples concerned. I must recall that our peoples have suffered from the effects of the austerity policies imposed by international financial institutions. But we must be careful not to cross the threshold of the unbearable; not to rend social cohesion and reduce the ability of African States to maintain it. There are tragic examples of the consequences of such a situation. The courageous efforts being made in Africa must be supported by more sustained action by industrialized countries. We must move from rhetoric to action, from declarations of intention to implementation. More than ever before, the adoption of an agenda for development must mark an opportunity to put the United Nations back at the centre of international activities for economic and social development. The United Nations must therefore have the resources needed to promote world peace, both in terms of the diplomatic and military operations necessary to ensure the security of individuals and peoples, and in terms of development operations for the greater well-being of all mankind. Only concerted action can enable us and future generations to live in peace. To tackle global problems that have no borders and that threaten our individual and collective existence, solidarity among peoples is more necessary than ever before. Suffice it to mention problems related to drugs, to the deterioration of the environment, to the misuse of rare and non-renewable resources, to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and to poverty. The United Nations has an essential role to play on all these fronts. While it is true that we must demand of the Organization greater effectiveness and better coordination of its efforts, we must also give it the means to implement all the resolutions we adopt and to realize the hopes we place in it. If we fail to back all our statements with adequate means, the Organization can only fall short of our peoples’ expectations. This is a risk we cannot and do not wish to run, for all of us who for years have been observing the development of mankind know that preventive diplomacy and development assistance are far less costly than conflict and war. We also know that combating poverty in all its forms is the most certain way of promoting peace on Earth, of facilitating trade and of combating the other global problems I have just set out. We also know full well that all States without exception are facing considerable budgetary problems. The temptation is great to reduce the share of these budgets devoted to United Nations peace and development operations; we understand this. But in a time of hardship we must be all the more careful about our decisions on the allocation of resources. We must ensure that economizing today does not lead to greater expenditures in the future. Sustained and proper financing of United Nations activities, accompanied by controls of quality and effectiveness to be sure, is a vital investment in the future of us all. Not to accomplish this because of short-term budgetary constraints would jeopardize longterm global development prospects. In each of our countries and collectively, we must reexamine the contribution and the effectiveness of the United Nations. I am convinced that this would enable us to better understand why the United Nations must enjoy the continued and increased support of the international community. Before concluding I want to thank everyone who has joined me in the inspiring task I have completed. I dedicate my final thoughts as President of the General Assembly to my country, Côte d’Ivoire, which I have endeavoured to represent with dignity and to the best of my moral and professional ability. I have always viewed my election as a tribute, not to me personally, but to my homeland and to the courageous and pragmatic policy incarnated in the father of the Ivoirian nation, President Félix Houphouët-Boigny. This policy is today continued with unswerving determination and faith by his worthy successor, President Henri Konan Bédié. President Henri Konan Bédié is today leading Côte d’Ivoire towards its great destiny through concrete economic and social achievements and through the consolidation of a democratic system which gives priority to full respect for human rights and for the dignity and civil liberties of all Ivoirians. I also thank the African Heads of State for their constant support, and to the Organization of African Unity and to the Group of African States at the United Nations for their readiness at all times to help. I thank the NonAligned Movement and the Group of 77 for their inestimable cooperation. My thanks go also to all the other regional groups at the United Nations, which in a gratifying way extended to me their friendship and constructive cooperation in the search for solutions to the many problems we faced. All this enabled me to carry out my responsibilities as fully as possible and in the best of conditions. Let me now convey my sincere thanks to the Secretary-General, His Excellency Mr. Boutros BoutrosGhali, a brother African whose support has been unfailing. I also thank the Vice-Presidents of the General Assembly and all the other Assembly officers, as well as the Chairmen and Vice-Chairmen of the Main Committees and the various working groups, who unfailingly assisted me and helped me accomplish my task. My thanks go also to the Under-Secretary-General, Mr. Alvaro de Soto, and his colleagues in the Division of General Assembly Affairs, and to the multitude of Secretariat staff members, seen and unseen, such as conference officers, editors, interpreters, translators, secretaries, typists, security staff, messengers, maintenance staff and those with the delicate and highly appreciated task of daily adorning our General Assembly offices with flowers. All helped us, at their respective levels, by carrying out their tasks with professionalism and dedication."

However, that action must take account of the great diversity of the international community and adapt itself accordingly, because nothing could be more dangerous than the sense that the institution bearing primary responsibility for peace-keeping acts only as an instrument in the service of certain Powers. No one denies that the Council has exceptional decision-making powers or that it imposes sanctions. However, Security Council action would benefit from enjoying the broadest possible consensus if partiality is to be avoided. It would not be desirable for the institutional imbalance between the Security Council and the General Assembly of the United Nations to be exacerbated. Such an imbalance would reflect an erroneous interpretation of the Charter, which, while opting for efficiency in the field of peace-keeping, has relinquished none of the competences of the General Assembly, an institution embodying the principle of the sovereign equality of the States Members of the Organization. I have also reflected on the question of international peace and security. Undeniably, the indefinite extension of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons must be noted as a major achievement in assuring international security. We are aware of the decisive role played by the General Assembly in bringing about that agreement, which was concluded on 11 May 1995 in New York. With respect to hotbeds of tension in general, when the Security Council was paralysed by the use of the veto we observed the General Assembly’s vigorous use of its powers emanating from the Charter, in particular Article 11. On many occasions it was involved in peace-keeping activities. Even if the world political situation is different from that which prevailed a few years ago, the General Assembly cannot be excluded from questions having to do with international peace and security. In this field, the work of our Organization must be preventive in nature, an issue that was very close to the heart of former SecretaryGeneral Dag Hammarskjöld. Preventive diplomacy is one of the fundamental bases of the policy defined by the present Secretary-General in his “An Agenda for Peace”. In this context, the General Assembly must have a greater role, and it is desirable that the recommendations of the Assembly’s Informal Open-ended Working Group on An Agenda for Peace contribute to the preparation of resolutions for the strengthening of peace. By reason of its universal composition and the range of viewpoints expressed in it, the General Assembly is the organ in the best position to fulfil the function of conflict prevention. From this standpoint, and without any prejudice to the competences of the Security Council, the Assembly must remain at the heart of the peace-keeping system as an organ for deliberation and prevention. There is another sphere in which the role of the Assembly is essential, namely that of fact-finding, which is so important in the quest for solutions or conflict prevention. Here, again, the work of the Assembly can reinforce and complement that of the Security Council with a view to greater effectiveness. I have also considered the problems of the financing of the Organization and of its actions for peace. As we all know, this question is vital for the future of the Organization and therefore to the maintenance of peace. The financial situation of the United Nations is one of grave crisis. The Secretary-General addressed the General Assembly on this subject on 12 October 1994, but he had also sounded the alarm on the financial picture on 22 June, before the High-level Open-ended Working Group on the Financial Situation of the Organization. The crisis is due, above all, to the fact that Member States do not pay in full and on time their financial contributions to the various budgets of the Organization. As of 10 August 1995, the unpaid balance of contributions amounted to $3.9 billion, of which $858.2 million corresponded to the regular budget and $3 billion to the budget for peace-keeping operations. Obviously, this situation affects the functioning and the effectiveness of the United Nations in all fields, especially that of peacekeeping. In the course of this session the General Assembly has reaffirmed the need to comply with Article 17 of the Charter, under which the financing of peace-keeping operations is the collective responsibility of all Member States. In “An Agenda for Peace”, the Secretary-General made some proposals concerning this issue, and some of them have been adopted by the General Assembly and implemented. What is really called for is that we should reflect on the matter together. More than ever before, the General Assembly must take the initiatives required in such a situation in order to free the Organization from the financial uncertainties now affecting it and to free it also from the control exercised in this area by certain Member States. In this regard, the boldest of measures should be envisaged to provide the Organization with appropriate and predictable resources. These solutions must in any event take into account the capacity of Member States to pay. The relationship between the United Nations and the regional organizations was of particular interest to me. This seems to me to be one of the most important questions for the future of international relations. The maintenance of peace calls for the implementation of the provisions of Chapter VIII of the Charter. The Security Council attaches great importance to the role of regional arrangements and organizations, and it considers it indispensable that their efforts be coordinated with those of the United Nations. In its resolution 47/71 (para. 52) the General Assembly expressly encouraged regional and subregional organizations to cooperate with the United Nations, in accordance with Chapter VIII of the Charter. The role of the General Assembly is therefore vital. Because of its universal composition, it is the venue par excellence for debating problems of regional security with a view to seeking viable solutions aimed at the establishment of lasting regional peace, which is a prerequisite for any form of development. I have also reflected on the relationship between the United Nations and world public opinion, and I have arrived at the conviction that the General Assembly must be the interpreter of international public opinion. For 50 years now, the General Assembly has been echoing international public opinion by contributing, through its many resolutions and conventions, to a significant evolution of positive international law. The role of the General Assembly has also contributed to the international community’s heightened awareness of problems related to economic and social development. One major innovation of the General Assembly along these lines is the holding of large world conferences. These conferences make it possible for broader debate to take place, and they generate concrete programmes of action. Dealing with issues from human rights in general to the specific situation of women, from sustainable development to the prevention of natural disasters, from population problems to those of the environment and from habitats to social development, they endeavour to reflect mankind’s aspirations for greater well-being. The participation of non-governmental organizations in these conferences and the ever greater mobilization of public opinion to which they lead are to be commended. We welcome the considerable progress achieved at Beijing on the long road towards the advancement of women. I want again to stress the decisive role of the General Assembly in all these conferences. I turn now to my own continent, Africa. At its substantive session, held at Geneva this summer, the Economic and Social Council focused its high-level debate on the development of Africa. It recalled the relevance and timeliness of the United Nations New Agenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s, along with the necessary framework of partnership between Africa and the international community, within which the objectives of the New Agenda should be attained. Unfortunately, we must note that, in the context of a globalized economy, Africa, despite courageous reform and considerable national efforts at adjustment, remains a marginalized continent with no real share in the overall growth of the world economy. Indeed, the simplified image of Africa too often seen in the international media does not reflect the revolution — let us not be afraid of a word — in which Africa is engaged. In the face of growing economic and social difficulties, our States are resolutely undertaking reforms aimed at improving our economies and at restoring basic economic balance. We are also promoting the State of law and the rules of democracy. The success of such undertakings depends on the support of our peoples. No reform whatsoever can succeed without the prior consent of the peoples concerned. I must recall that our peoples have suffered from the effects of the austerity policies imposed by international financial institutions. But we must be careful not to cross the threshold of the unbearable; not to rend social cohesion and reduce the ability of African States to maintain it. There are tragic examples of the consequences of such a situation. The courageous efforts being made in Africa must be supported by more sustained action by industrialized countries. We must move from rhetoric to action, from declarations of intention to implementation. More than ever before, the adoption of an agenda for development must mark an opportunity to put the United Nations back at the centre of international activities for economic and social development. The United Nations must therefore have the resources needed to promote world peace, both in terms of the diplomatic and military operations necessary to ensure the security of individuals and peoples, and in terms of development operations for the greater well-being of all mankind. Only concerted action can enable us and future generations to live in peace. To tackle global problems that have no borders and that threaten our individual and collective existence, solidarity among peoples is more necessary than ever before. Suffice it to mention problems related to drugs, to the deterioration of the environment, to the misuse of rare and non-renewable resources, to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and to poverty. The United Nations has an essential role to play on all these fronts. While it is true that we must demand of the Organization greater effectiveness and better coordination of its efforts, we must also give it the means to implement all the resolutions we adopt and to realize the hopes we place in it. If we fail to back all our statements with adequate means, the Organization can only fall short of our peoples’ expectations. This is a risk we cannot and do not wish to run, for all of us who for years have been observing the development of mankind know that preventive diplomacy and development assistance are far less costly than conflict and war. We also know that combating poverty in all its forms is the most certain way of promoting peace on Earth, of facilitating trade and of combating the other global problems I have just set out. We also know full well that all States without exception are facing considerable budgetary problems. The temptation is great to reduce the share of these budgets devoted to United Nations peace and development operations; we understand this. But in a time of hardship we must be all the more careful about our decisions on the allocation of resources. We must ensure that economizing today does not lead to greater expenditures in the future. Sustained and proper financing of United Nations activities, accompanied by controls of quality and effectiveness to be sure, is a vital investment in the future of us all. Not to accomplish this because of short-term budgetary constraints would jeopardize longterm global development prospects. In each of our countries and collectively, we must reexamine the contribution and the effectiveness of the United Nations. I am convinced that this would enable us to better understand why the United Nations must enjoy the continued and increased support of the international community. Before concluding I want to thank everyone who has joined me in the inspiring task I have completed. I dedicate my final thoughts as President of the General Assembly to my country, Côte d’Ivoire, which I have endeavoured to represent with dignity and to the best of my moral and professional ability. I have always viewed my election as a tribute, not to me personally, but to my homeland and to the courageous and pragmatic policy incarnated in the father of the Ivoirian nation, President Félix Houphouët-Boigny. This policy is today continued with unswerving determination and faith by his worthy successor, President Henri Konan Bédié. President Henri Konan Bédié is today leading Côte d’Ivoire towards its great destiny through concrete economic and social achievements and through the consolidation of a democratic system which gives priority to full respect for human rights and for the dignity and civil liberties of all Ivoirians. I also thank the African Heads of State for their constant support, and to the Organization of African Unity and to the Group of African States at the United Nations for their readiness at all times to help. I thank the NonAligned Movement and the Group of 77 for their inestimable cooperation. My thanks go also to all the other regional groups at the United Nations, which in a gratifying way extended to me their friendship and constructive cooperation in the search for solutions to the many problems we faced. All this enabled me to carry out my responsibilities as fully as possible and in the best of conditions. Let me now convey my sincere thanks to the Secretary-General, His Excellency Mr. Boutros BoutrosGhali, a brother African whose support has been unfailing. I also thank the Vice-Presidents of the General Assembly and all the other Assembly officers, as well as the Chairmen and Vice-Chairmen of the Main Committees and the various working groups, who unfailingly assisted me and helped me accomplish my task. My thanks go also to the Under-Secretary-General, Mr. Alvaro de Soto, and his colleagues in the Division of General Assembly Affairs, and to the multitude of Secretariat staff members, seen and unseen, such as conference officers, editors, interpreters, translators, secretaries, typists, security staff, messengers, maintenance staff and those with the delicate and highly appreciated task of daily adorning our General Assembly offices with flowers. All helped us, at their respective levels, by carrying out their tasks with professionalism and dedication."
10296,"Razali Ismail, PGA Closing Speech",http://undocs.org/en/A/51/PV.107,Razali Ismail,President of the General Assembly,Inauguration Speech,1996,,"The President: It is customary for the President to conclude by mapping out the contours of the session and by summarizing the various achievements of the General Assembly. Without seeming to dramatize the fifty-first session, I would like to offer my impressions of the year. To me, the fifty-first session of the General Assembly has been a time of knuckling down to work and more work, minimizing the ceremonials and concentrating creative energies to overcome political wills in discord, in an effort to advance the purposes and principles of the Charter and to reform the Organization. I would like to believe that perhaps a spirit of partnership is being forged across both sides of the house in a collective effort to enhance greater transparency and to modernize the United Nations for the challenges ahead. Having got through the regular session with what I would like to believe is a new work culture and discarding the syndrome of “business as usual”, which has resulted in a year’s notional savings of $2 million, the General Assembly has laboured over various aspects of reform and restructuring through the five Working Groups. There was also the presentation of the Secretary-General’s two-track blueprint to “quietly revolutionize” the Organization. Reform fever aside, the year was notable also for the appointment of a new Secretary-General, the special session for the overall review and appraisal of the implementation of Agenda 21 and the tenth emergency special session, on the occupied territories. It is a matter of some satisfaction that we managed to complete the Agenda for Development and the work of the Open-ended High-level Working Group on the Strengthening of the United Nations System, but we must note how much was unfinished and unfulfilled in order to achieve consensus. While the political significance of the Agenda for Development is embedded in the completion of the document itself, the fact that it does not represent collateral or guarantee greater financial resources for the United Nations role in operationalizing development remains a disappointment for developing countries. International cooperation exercised nationally, globally and in partnership with other stakeholders came to a serious impasse at the special session. Governments could not even agree on a political declaration that would honestly assess our record on implementing the commitments undertaken at the Rio Summit. The bareboned outcome of the session neither set new targets nor catalysed resources for programmes, even when the subject of sustainable development holds enormous appeal for Governments and the public alike. The special session was telling in its illustration of the United Nations inability to grapple with the failure of Governments and its marginalization as a norm-setting institution that is too weak to convert consensus into material and tangible terms. With official development assistance in decline and the political leverage of transnational business and industry in ascendancy, I wonder whether pressure can be exerted to make a difference at the upcoming session of the Conference of the Parties to the Framework Convention on Climate Change, at Kyoto. This would seem unlikely, as the United Nations seems relegated to dealing only with the soft issues and not the hard issues of economics. There are clearly lessons to be learned in our approach to determining the results of other global conferences. The participation of non-governmental organizations at the special session was a milestone event that gave some nourishment to the much-touted and distorted expressions of empowerment and democratization. However, it is one of my disappointments that the wider issue of non-governmental organization participation in the work of the United Nations remains unresolved. Despite extensive efforts to clarify and move the issue forward in the Sub-Group on Non-Governmental Organizations, the intransigence of a few and the politicization of the subject did not even allow the subgroup to agree on its mandate. While some are concerned about the logistical aspects of dealing with nongovernmental organizations — claiming that there are not enough seats or enough meeting time to cater for them — some in fact fear the prospects of greater transparency, accountability and public participation in the intergovernmental decision-making process and use all manner of legal arguments to prevent this from happening. This approach illustrates that the United Nations is treated ultimately by Governments as a creature of national self-interest where national sovereignty is supreme, however and by whomever that is defined, and not equipped with conditions to reflect universal rights and growing transnational concerns. A mix of governmental, intergovernmental and non-governmental voices in the United Nations would reflect reality more closely than a nation-State-imposed United Nations and would give it added legitimacy. The proposed peoples’ assembly cannot be a substitute for the role of non-governmental organizations in the decision-making process of the United Nations. Though the Agenda for Peace has been adopted, even if not in full, conflict between countries on what is sovereign and what is not on issues of peace and security continues to rear its head, with both sides claiming legitimacy. On the subject of the emergency special session, twice this year the General Assembly flexed its muscle in the absence of unanimity among permanent members of the Security Council on the issue of illegal Israeli actions in occupied East Jerusalem and the rest of the occupied Palestinian territories. I would recommend seeking greater recourse in the General Assembly through the resolution “Uniting for peace”, to those members that cannot find due justice in the Security Council. In the final days of the regular session the General Assembly and the presidency responded effectively and played an impartial and constructive role in selecting a Secretary-General when assertive unilateralism provoked deadlock in the Security Council and threatened to undermine the integrity of the institution of the United Nations itself. A comprehensive package to reform the Security Council remains a tantalizing prospect, but countries first have to comprehend the universal aspirations for change in a United Nations mired in ways of governance that are less than democratic. Security Council reform is delayed not only by the logic of those who do not want to redistribute power, but also by those who would prefer the status quo and fear expansion in both categories. Unanimity on this politically loaded and complicated issue will never be possible. Nor will there be any kind of reform if the Working Group becomes the amphitheater for obstructionist views that speak of principles but exploit the diversity of views and block discussions on the way forward. I have tried without partisanship — even if a few will not believe me — and with a mixture of caution and innovation, to eke out a mainstream position on the reform of the Security Council and to provide a blueprint of how this is to be done. I have come close. The proposals remain on the table and can be taken up by interested States and brought to final conclusion. The most disappointing and perhaps the most crucial piece of unfinished business of the fifty-first session is the continuing stalemate over the issue of payment of arrears and of restoring fiscal stability to the Organization. The financial crippling of the United Nations continues to obstruct the momentum for reform, preventing constructive negotiations for genuine reform of the Organization. Arguments about complicated legislative procedures, attaching arbitrary conditions to payments and using the media to cast a different version do not reduce what is simply a solemn treaty obligation. Blind unilateralism will be the undoing of the United Nations. Dare I hazard any conclusions from all this? What continued to emerge from the fifty-first session were the difficulties of consensus as an instrument upon which the intergovernmental decisions of the United Nations must be built, but which can also be used as a tool to prevent practical and necessary decisions from being taken. Speaking for myself, we have a long way to go if we are to replace our narrow and unhelpful a la carte approach to United Nations reforms with a comprehensive one. The Secretary General’s reform proposal deserves our full and expeditious attention without becoming a casualty to politics. The task of strengthening the United Nations will depend in large part on the Organization’s ability to adapt to change, beyond creeping incremental adjustments. This will not be easy, of course, as we do not yet share a common premise of what constitutes reform. And in this respect, the diversity of the United Nations is its greatest strength and its greatest weakness. Every aspect of the United Nations remains a stake and a prize in the escalating debate between the North and the South. Each side has conflicting claims on fundamental values and perspectives, causing political gridlock in many aspects of reform. While it is evident in the governmental and Secretariat contexts that major countries place a high premium on the fact that reform should not in any manner affect their rights, prerogatives and status, developing countries on the other hand lack capacity and are often not united, stressing at times form over substance, even as their negotiating power declines and the coherence of other political groupings strengthens. The United Nations will not be strengthened if reform only concentrates on cost-effectiveness, efficiency and better coordination. Such objectives alone would divert attention from the United Nations’ real functions and Charter responsibilities. If the United Nations is to survive, it has to transform itself from an organization serving only the interests of States to one serving the interests of peoples living in an interdependent and global society. On my part, I have tried my best, to the best of my ability, to use the potential of my office to revitalize the role of the General Assembly, consistent with its mandates and the United Nations Charter. I have done so with transparency and without bias, many times using the lure of Malaysian meals to draw the ambassadors into discussions in times of progress and deadlock. While efforts to bring the Secretariat and intergovernmental sides of the house together have helped to dispel myths and ease certain tensions, it has also been necessary on occasion to draw distinctions between those roles and responsibilities. Drawing such distinctions has in itself helped to dispense with a ceremonial and protocol-driven Presidency and created a more proactive working office. I have devoted a lot of effort to interacting with the world outside the United Nations, keeping my door open not only to Government representatives, but to nongovernmental organizations, students, the business community, universities and journalists in equal measure. I have also gone to the field to witness suffering and deprivation by visiting refugee camps, even if I could not take up the many invitations from various Governments. Far from being an exercise in winning popularity, this has been a serious attempt to explain multilateralism and the role of the United Nations — its purposes, inner workings, strengths and contradictions — in plain terms, without glitz or rhetoric. Speaking frankly, and I hope wisely, has helped to distinguish form from substance, framing the shape of difficult issues ahead as the roles of Governments, international organizations and non-state actors are being redefined. One of my most memorable events was United Nations Day, when, in stark contrast to the summit of the Fiftieth Anniversary celebrations, we gave children from around the world the chance to speak in their own words of their hopes for the United Nations. I have tried to strike a balance between vision and practicality, avoiding wooly idealism so as to make things happen through the issues themselves. I had hoped for effervescence and a combined sense of purpose. If only we, as ambassadors, could have gone beyond our basic national positions, allowing multilateralism to take root. At the end of the day the unfinished business and the inertia that accompanies it is because of entrenched national positions and their attendant politics. The United Nations has not yet found a formula to become a universal house which can diffuse the debilitating aspects of power politics, or overcome bilateral and sub-regional hostilities which stand in the way of effectuating the universal values of the Charter. We speak so much about globalism and interdependence but are helpless in the face of our built-in discordance. We must not allow those false prophets who speak of the clash of civilizations to be proven true. The United Nations must relate to the real world. I believe in underlining the importance of the socalled silent majority, who must be heard. Their collective voice can silence even the most powerful. Finally, my sincere thanks to everyone, especially those who assisted me in many special ways, perhaps without really comprehending the method in my madness, but who nevertheless gave me the benefit of the doubt and found enjoyment nonetheless. For me and my country, Malaysia, it has been a great honour to serve you and the United Nations."
10297,"Bill Clinton, Presidential Inauguration Speech",https://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/clinton2.asp,Bill Clinton,President (United States),Inauguration Speech,1997,,"My fellow citizens :
At this last presidential inauguration of the 20th century, let us lift our eyes toward the challenges that await us in the next century. It is our great good fortune that time and chance have put us not only at the edge of a new century, in a new millennium, but on the edge of a bright new prospect in human affairs, a moment that will define our course, and our character, for decades to come. We must keep our old democracy forever young. Guided by the ancient vision of a promised land, let us set our sights upon a land of new promise.
The promise of America was born in the 18th century out of the bold conviction that we are all created equal. It was extended and preserved in the 19th century, when our nation spread across the continent, saved the union, and abolished the awful scourge of slavery.
Then, in turmoil and triumph, that promise exploded onto the world stage to make this the American Century.
And what a century it has been. America became the world's mightiest industrial power; saved the world from tyranny in two world wars and a long cold war; and time and again, reached out across the globe to millions who, like us, longed for the blessings of liberty.
Along the way, Americans produced a great middle class and security in old age; built unrivaled centers of learning and opened public schools to all; split the atom and explored the heavens; invented the computer and the microchip; and deepened the wellspring of justice by making a revolution in civil rights for African Americans and all minorities, and extending the circle of citizenship, opportunity and dignity to women.

Now, for the third time, a new century is upon us, and another time to choose. We began the 19th century with a choice, to spread our nation from coast to coast. We began the 20th century with a choice, to harness the Industrial Revolution to our values of free enterprise, conservation, and human decency. Those choices made all the difference.

At the dawn of the 21st century a free people must now choose to shape the forces of the Information Age and the global society, to unleash the limitless potential of all our people, and, yes, to form a more perfect union.

When last we gathered, our march to this new future seemed less certain than it does today. We vowed then to set a clear course to renew our nation.

In these four years, we have been touched by tragedy, exhilarated by challenge, strengthened by achievement. America stands alone as the world's indispensable nation. Once again, our economy is the strongest on Earth. Once again, we are building stronger families, thriving communities, better educational opportunities, a cleaner environment. Problems that once seemed destined to deepen now bend to our efforts: our streets are safer and record numbers of our fellow citizens have moved from welfare to work.

And once again, we have resolved for our time a great debate over the role of government. Today we can declare: Government is not the problem, and government is not the solution. We,- the American people, we are the solution. Our founders understood that well and gave us a democracy strong enough to endure for centuries, flexible enough to face our common challenges and advance our common dreams in each new day.

As times change, so government must change. We need a new government for a new century - humble enough not to try to solve all our problems for us, but strong enough to give us the tools to solve our problems for ourselves; a government that is smaller, lives within its means, and does more with less. Yet where it can stand up for our values and interests in the world, and where it can give Americans the power to make a real difference in their everyday lives, government should do more, not less. The preeminent mission of our new government is to give all Americans an opportunity,- not a guarantee, but a real opportunity to build better lives.

Beyond that, my fellow citizens, the future is up to us. Our founders taught us that the preservation of our liberty and our union depends upon responsible citizenship. And we need a new sense of responsibility for a new century. There is work to do, work that government alone cannot do: teaching children to read; hiring people off welfare rolls; coming out from behind locked doors and shuttered windows to help reclaim our streets from drugs and gangs and crime; taking time out of our own lives to serve others.

Each and every one of us, in our own way, must assume personal responsibility, not only for ourselves and our families, but for our neighbors and our nation. Our greatest responsibility is to embrace a new spirit of community for a new century. For any one of us to succeed, we must succeed as one America.

The challenge of our past remains the challenge of our future, will we be one nation, one people, with one common destiny, or not? Will we all come together, or come apart?

The divide of race has been America's constant curse. And each new wave of immigrants gives new targets to old prejudices. Prejudice and contempt, cloaked in the pretense of religious or political conviction are no different. These forces have nearly destroyed our nation in the past. They plague us still. They fuel the fanaticism of terror. And they torment the lives of millions in fractured nations all around the world.

These obsessions cripple both those who hate and, of course, those who are hated, robbing both of what they might become. We cannot, we will not, succumb to the dark impulses that lurk in the far regions of the soul everywhere. We shall overcome them. And we shall replace them with the generous spirit of a people who feel at home with one another.

Our rich texture of racial, religious and political diversity will be a Godsend in the 21st century. Great rewards will come to those who can live together, learn together, work together, forge new ties that bind together.

As this new era approaches we can already see its broad outlines. Ten years ago, the Internet was the mystical province of physicists; today, it is a commonplace encyclopedia for millions of schoolchildren. Scientists now are decoding the blueprint of human life. Cures for our most feared illnesses seem close at hand.

The world is no longer divided into two hostile camps. Instead, now we are building bonds with nations that once were our adversaries. Growing connections of commerce and culture give us a chance to lift the fortunes and spirits of people the world over. And for the very first time in all of history, more people on this planet live under democracy than dictatorship.

My fellow Americans, as we look back at this remarkable century, we may ask, can we hope not just to follow, but even to surpass the achievements of the 20th century in America and to avoid the awful bloodshed that stained its legacy? To that question, every American here and every American in our land today must answer a resounding ""Yes.""

This is the heart of our task. With a new vision of government, a new sense of responsibility, a new spirit of community, we will sustain America's journey. The promise we sought in a new land we will find again in a land of new promise.

In this new land, education will be every citizen's most prized possession. Our schools will have the highest standards in the world, igniting the spark of possibility in the eyes of every girl and every boy. And the doors of higher education will be open to all. The knowledge and power of the Information Age will be within reach not just of the few, but of every classroom, every library, every child. Parents and children will have time not only to work, but to read and play together. And the plans they make at their kitchen table will be those of a better home, a better job, the certain chance to go to college.

Our streets will echo again with the laughter of our children, because no one will try to shoot them or sell them drugs anymore. Everyone who can work, will work, with today's permanent under class part of tomorrow's growing middle class. New miracles of medicine at last will reach not only those who can claim care now, but the children and hardworking families too long denied.

We will stand mighty for peace and freedom, and maintain a strong defense against terror and destruction. Our children will sleep free from the threat of nuclear, chemical or biological weapons. Ports and airports, farms and factories will thrive with trade and innovation and ideas. And the world's greatest democracy will lead a whole world of democracies.

Our land of new promise will be a nation that meets its obligations, a nation that balances its budget, but never loses the balance of its values. A nation where our grandparents have secure retirement and health care, and their grandchildren know we have made the reforms necessary to sustain those benefits for their time. A nation that fortifies the world's most productive economy even as it protects the great natural bounty of our water, air, and majestic land.

And in this land of new promise, we will have reformed our politics so that the voice of the people will always speak louder than the din of narrow interests, regaining the participation and deserving the trust of all Americans.

Fellow citizens, let us build that America, a nation ever moving forward toward realizing the full potential of all its citizens. Prosperity and power, yes, they are important, and we must maintain them. But let us never forget: The greatest progress we have made, and the greatest progress we have yet to make, is in the human heart. In the end, all the world's wealth and a thousand armies are no match for the strength and decency of the human spirit.

Thirty-four years ago, the man whose life we celebrate today spoke to us down there, at the other end of this Mall, in words that moved the conscience of a nation. Like a prophet of old, he told of his dream that one day America would rise up and treat all its citizens as equals before the law and in the heart. Martin Luther King's dream was the American Dream. His quest is our quest: the ceaseless striving to live out our true creed. Our history has been built on such dreams and labors. And by our dreams and labors we will redeem the promise of America in the 21st century.

To that effort I pledge all my strength and every power of my office. I ask the members of Congress here to join in that pledge. The American people returned to office a President of one party and a Congress of another. Surely, they did not do this to advance the politics of petty bickering and extreme partisanship they plainly deplore. No, they call on us instead to be repairers of the breach, and to move on with America's mission.

America demands and deserves big things from us,- and nothing big ever came from being small. Let us remember the timeless wisdom of Cardinal Bernardin, when facing the end of his own life. He said, ""It is wrong to waste the precious gift of time, on acrimony and division.""

Fellow citizens, we must not waste the precious gift of this time. For all of us are on that same journey of our lives, and our journey, too, will come to an end. But the journey of our America must go on.

And so, my fellow Americans, we must be strong, for there is much to dare. The demands of our time are great and they are different. Let us meet them with faith and courage, with patience and a grateful and happy heart. Let us shape the hope of this day into the noblest chapter in our history. Yes, let us build our bridge. A bridge wide enough and strong enough for every American to cross over to a blessed land of new promise.

May those generations whose faces we cannot yet see, whose names we may never know, say of us here that we led our beloved land into a new century with the American Dream alive for all her children; with the American promise of a more perfect union a reality for all her people; with America's bright flame of freedom spreading throughout all the world.

From the height of this place and the summit of this century, let us go forth. May God strengthen our hands for the good work ahead, and always, always bless our America."
10298,"Kofi Annan, SG Inauguration Speech",http://undocs.org/en/A/51/PV.88,Kofi Annan,Secretary General (United Nations),Inauguration Speech,1997,,"The Secretary-General (interpretation from Arabic): I should like to begin my statement by expressing my deep sense of gratitude and appreciation. I convey a personal greeting to all States Members of this Organization, a special greeting and acknowledgement to all the Heads of State or Government who have honoured me with their support and assistance, and my sincere gratitude to Their Excellencies the Ministers, Permanent Representatives and members of delegations for their support and help. I am grateful for the valuable help provided by my aides, who have assisted me in discharging my functions over the past years. I should like also to acknowledge everyone who has helped to maintain the credibility of the United Nations and the independence of its soul.
Five years ago, responsibility for the Office of Secretary-General was placed in my hands. I am grateful to have had the privilege of serving the peoples of the United Nations during this time. Today I am proud of the way the United Nations has responded to the challenges of these difficult years. I have had the difficult task of guiding the United Nations during the post-cold-war period. The next century has already begun. Great transformations do not wait for the calendar. The past five-year period opened with optimism and enthusiasm. Member States called on the United Nations to take action, on an unprecedented scale, for peace, development, democratization and reform. My first act for peace as Secretary-General was to sign at Chapultepec on 16 January 1992 the Agreement on peace for El Salvador, a great achievement by my distinguished predecessor, Mr. Pérez de Cuéllar. The first-ever Summit Meeting of the Security Council took place on 31 January 1992. My report issued in May 1992, “An Agenda for Peace”, launched an international debate on preventive diplomacy, peacemaking, peacekeeping and the new concept of post-conflict peace-building. From El Salvador to Cambodia to Angola and Mozambique, the United Nations adapted United Nations peacekeeping to unprecedented forms of conflict.
Development also was given a new opportunity. The easing of ideological tensions and the expected peace dividend raised hopes for development cooperation. The landmark Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in June 1992 yielded the first-ever global plan — Agenda 21 — for a new and equitable partnership to achieve sustainable development. Democratization became a new feature of the work of the United Nations. Member States, new and old, turned to the United Nations for support in democratization. The United Nations quickly developed its capacity to provide electoral assistance. It was clear to me, as I took up the office of Secretary-General, that the United Nations would have to undergo comprehensive change. I simplified Secretariat structures and began a process of managerial reform. This, in turn, stimulated more demand for reform. Throughout the period leading up to the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations, reform was the issue of the day. In Governments, universities and foundations drew up proposals for restructuring and reorganizing. But the middle years of this half-decade were deeply troubled. Disillusion set in. Where peacekeepers were asked to deal with warfare, serious setbacks occurred. The first came in Somalia, and it weakened the will of the world community to act against genocide in Rwanda. In Bosnia, too, hard choices were avoided. The concept of peacekeeping was turned on its head and worsened by the serious gap between mandates and resources. The volume of assistance to developing countries was not only failing to grow, it was, in fact, declining. Resources for long-term development were being diverted to emergency efforts. Africa was hit hardest. Despite high hopes for democratization, a counter-trend emerged. Atrocities in violation of human rights reached unprecedented levels. The horror of ethnic cleansing emerged. In some countries, democratization proved more difficult than expected, creating political instability, social disarray and economic disappointment. Democratization in some cases slowed, or was even eroded. And it emerged that the conditions for major reform of the United Nations did not yet exist. The decisions required far exceeded the authority of any Secretary-General. Extensive reform of the United Nations can emerge only from a consensus among Member States on the goals of reform. Until such a consensus exists, and until the political will emerges to take hard decisions and to reform intergovernmental machinery along with Secretariat structures, major institutional reform will be very difficult. And throughout this time of disillusion, the Organization’s financial crisis continued to pose a serious obstacle to reform. The United Nations is emerging from the mood of disillusion. The fiftieth anniversary brought an impressive recommitment by Member States to their world Organization. A new sense of maturity seems possible. We have begun to restore the logic of United Nations peacekeeping and to clarify our approach to the range of instruments contained in the Charter. The division of labour between the United Nations and regional organizations continues to improve. As I described to the Lyon Summit of the Group of Seven last June, the United Nations is now working closely with the Bretton Woods institutions on development policy and on projects in the field. The flagship of this effort is the System-wide Special Initiative on Africa, which I inaugurated earlier this year. And a new global policy consensus has begun to take shape. The Rio Conference on Environment and Development, the Vienna Conference on Human Rights, the Yokohama Conference on Natural Disaster Reduction, the Cairo Conference on Population and Development, the Naples Conference on Transnational Crime, the Barbados Conference on the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States, the Copenhagen World Summit for Social Development, the Beijing Conference on Women; the Istanbul Conference on Human Settlements and the ninth United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD IX), on globalization and liberalization in South Africa — all have been dedicated to the betterment of the individual human person. Taken together, this series of conferences has created an entirely new dimension of international cooperation. It has set the stage for restoring development and international economic cooperation to the place it should occupy on the agenda of the United Nations, as a major objective of the Organization in its own right and as a precondition for lasting peace and progress. This is the Charter’s conception. This is the conception that the Group of 77 has struggled long and hard to defend. And this should be a key objective of further reform of the Organization in the economic and social area. For democratization, a more comprehensive and effective United Nations approach is taking shape.
Beyond help in holding free and fair elections, the United Nations today offers a range of forms of assistance, from support for a culture of democratization to institution-building. To succeed over time, democratization within a nation must be supported by a process of democratization among nations. The democratization of the international system is one of the greatest tasks ahead. The past few years have brought a new and wide recognition that reform is well under way. The path forward can now be seen. Roles and responsibilities are more clearly understood. Key issues of intergovernmental reform relating to the Security Council, assessments and peacekeeping debts are seen to be linked. Proposals are being put forward by Member States for the settlement of arrears. Most importantly, there is a new recognition that reform is not an end in itself. Reform which seeks to turn the United Nations away from its fundamental responsibilities under the Charter can legitimately be opposed. The test of true reform will be whether it will improve the capacity of the United Nations to meet those responsibilities and to advance the common objectives of the peoples of the United Nations and its Member States. The downward trend has been broken. What is emerging is a United Nations that is more mature in outlook and stronger in achievement; a United Nations aware not only of its potentialities, but also of its limits. Enthusiasm, disillusion and realism: This has been the history of the United Nations over the past five years. Now, let us look to the future. Some old problems appear to be solved. But new problems and old problems in new forms have emerged. For some, the world seems more secure. But for many others, devastation, death and despair have become more common. For some, economic progress races forward. But for vast numbers of others, stark poverty crushes hope in every dimension of personal and community life. What use the world makes of the United Nations in the next few years can affect the course of world affairs for generations to come. Most immediately, the financial crisis continues. Just as my predecessor said to this Assembly in his last address, I too must state that I have been unable to resolve the financial crisis. This is a threat to the future of the United Nations that began over a decade ago. We know what is causing it, and we know what is needed to end it. It is not the result of mismanagement. It is the refusal to fulfil a treaty obligation. Now that a new Secretary-General is being appointed, all arrears should be paid at once, as has been promised so often in the past few months. In saying farewell to this great Assembly, I want to stress that nothing is more precious to the United Nations than its reputation. That reputation rests on four pillars: impartiality, equity, efficiency and achievement. A fifth principle is independence. If one word above all is to characterize the role of the Secretary-General, it is independence. The holder of this office must never be seen as acting out of fear or attempting to curry favour with one State or group of States. Should that happen, all prospects for the United Nations would be lost. The Secretary-General’s loyalty must be international, and nothing but international. An international civil service must be a real civil service. Throughout the past five years, the first thing I thought about when I woke up in the morning was my responsibility as Secretary-General to the ideals of the Charter, and the independence and credibility of the Organization.
By way of conclusion, my thoughts go to all the men and women of goodwill with whom I have worked over these past years to confront the difficulties that we have all faced together. I have appreciated their competence, their devotion and their self-denial. Sometimes I have also had to pay tribute to their sacrifices. All those men and women who are devoted to the general interests of the international community are the real wealth — the real future — of this world Organization. I assure them today of my highest consideration and gratitude. In particular, I should like to congratulate the new Secretary-General of the United Nations, Kofi Annan, who has served this institution for many years with tenacity, competence and great energy. I am convinced that his varied experience will be useful in resolving problems that he will confront and in defending the interests of the Secretariat and of the entire staff of this world Organization. Finally, I would like to thank the General Assembly for having five years ago to me entrusted this high post in which I have continued the work that I have been conducting for so long now in the service of peace, development and human rights. You can count on me to continue to place my energies in the service of the great ideals of the Charter. You can count on me to continue to defend the United Nations.

10299,"Tony Blair, PM Inauguration Speech",http://www.britishpoliticalspeech.org/speech-archive.htm?speech=203,Tony Blair,Prime Minister (United Kingdom),Inauguration Speech,1997,,"After 18 long years of Opposition, of frustration and despair, I am proud, privileged, to stand before you as the new Labour Prime Minister of our country. I believe in Britain. I believe in the British people. One cross on the ballot paper. One nation was reborn.

Today I want to set an ambitious course for this country. To be nothing less than the model 21st century nation, a beacon to the world. It means drawing deep into the richness of the British character. Creative. Compassionate. Outward-looking. Old British values, but a new British confidence. We can never be the biggest. We may never again be the mightiest. But we can be the best. The best place to live. The best place to bring up children, the best place to lead a fulfilled life, the best place to grow old.

14 years ago our Party was written off as history. This year we made it. Let our first thanks be to the British people. You kept faith with us. And we will keep faith with you. Thank you to the Party organisation, the volunteers, the professionals who fashioned the finest political fighting machine anywhere in the world. And thanks to those that led before me. To Neil Kinnock: the mantle of Prime Minister was never his. But I know that without him, it would never have been mine. To John Smith: who left us a fine legacy, and to whom we can now leave a fitting monument - a Scottish Parliament in the city where he lived, serving the country he loved and the people who loved him. To Jim Callaghan: who was attending Labour Party Conferences before I was born; and by the look of him, will be attending long after I’ve gone. My own debt of honour to Michael Foot: you led this Party when, frankly, it was incapable of being led and without ever losing a shred of your decency or your integrity. Thank you.

I should also say a final word of thanks to the Tory Party. Let’s be honest, we’d never have done so well without them. So thanks to Michael Howard, to John Redwood, to Peter Lilley, to Brian Mawhinney. Of course, it’s a fresh start now - with Michael Howard, John Redwood, Peter Lilley, Brian Mawhinney. Sorry – ‘Sir’ Brian Mawhinney - knighted for services to the Conservative Party. John Prescott wanted to give him a peerage - for services to the Labour Party.

As for Government, well, it beats the hell out of Opposition. They really do say ‘Yes, Prime Minister.’ You have to learn a whole new language. They’re not in the habit of calling anything a good idea, which given the last 18 years is hardly surprising. When they describe a proposal as ‘ambitious,’ or, even worse, ‘interesting,’ what they really mean is they think it was a stupid idea, dreamed up at the last minute for the manifesto. When they describe it as ‘challenging,’ they mean there's not a hope in hell of making it work. And when they say of a policy ‘that it really is quite a brave proposal Prime Minister,’ it means they’ve got the doctor outside waiting to sign the certificates and they’ve just applied for a transfer to a senior job administering one of our few remaining dependent territories.

It’s not the titles and the cars and the trappings that make government worthwhile. It’s letters like this from 11 year old Emma O’Brien from Ellesmere Port. ‘Summer School was a good idea. I have started to read more books. I have learned more spellings. We’ve had fun. All of us have made new friends. I think you and parliament have done the right thing. I have got a better education.’ Or this one from Mrs Patricia Lewis, of South London. ‘Each afternoon I collected him from school. By the fourth day the change was showing in Stephen. His enthusiasm grew, confidence gained, his ability to read, write, spell, speak, and question politely, was amazing.’ That is why we are here. That is what made winning worth the fight.

Ours was not a victory of politicians but of people. The people took their trust, and gave it to us. I want them to say, this week as they watch us here in Brighton: we did the right thing. I want the British people to be as proud of having elected us as we are to serve them. We won because we are New Labour, because we had the courage to change ourselves, and the discipline to take hard decisions, whilst remaining united. The lessons we learned in Opposition we carry on applying in Government. The moment we stop that is the moment we will stop being in government. Even now, especially now, no complacency.

I know I’m obsessive about this. But I will admit now that I perhaps went over the top when I phoned Millbank Tower on election night to say people were behaving as though it was in the bag. ‘Look,’ I was told, ‘We’ve got 150 seats. The Tories have got 6. It’s hard to persuade the media this thing’s on a knife edge.’ But still, no complacency.

May 1st was the beginning, not the end. We have never won two full consecutive terms of office. Never. That is one more record I want to break. No cockiness about the Tories even now. They’re not dead. Just sleeping.Let their fate serve as a warning to us. What the people give, the people can take away. We are the servants. They are the masters now. To govern Britain is a privilege not a right. Never forget it.

Last year we were talking about what we would do. This year we’re doing it. That ten point contract with the British people - we are honouring.

We said we would get more money into schools and hospitals. We have - 2.2 billion more than Tories planned to spend next year.

We said we’d sign the Social Chapter. We did.

We said we’d restore trade unions at GCHQ. On May 19, free and independent trade unions came back to GCHQ.

We said we’d set up a Low Pay Commission. We have, and the national minimum wage is on its way.

We said we’d legislate to release the money from selling council homes in order to house the homeless. We’ve done it.

We said we’d cut class sizes, by scrapping the Assisted Places Scheme. The law to do it has been passed.

We’ve given the people of Scotland and Wales the devolution referendums we promised, and they have voted: yes, yes, and yes again.

We said we’d reform the Lottery to address the people’s priorities. We have, and today more proposals on how we'll reform it further and get more money to more local projects, the length and breadth of Britain, preparing for the millennium.

We said we’d cut VAT on fuel. We have.

We never said we’d cut corporation tax. But we did anyway, to the lowest level it’s ever been. And we have brought Britain's top business brains right into the heart of Government.

And we said we’d force the water companies to give a better deal to their customers. A few hours of quiet diplomacy by Mr John Prescott did the necessary, and the companies did the business.

We owed a debt to the people of Dunblane. We said MPs would vote to ban handguns. MPs have had that vote. The people have spoken. Parliament has spoken. Handguns are banned. We have honoured our debt.

We said we’d ban landmines. They’re banned in Britain and we’ll keep working until they are banned the world over.

Of all we have done, ask me what has taken the most time, the most effort, it’s probably Northern Ireland. There is no tougher job in Government than Northern Ireland Secretary, and there is no better person to do it than Mo Mowlam. The effort has been worth it. The cease-fire has been renewed. Republicans and Unionists are talking for the first time since 1921. There is a long, long way to go. Every step is fragile. But in the name of humanity, I ask that ancient enmities be put aside. Talking is no treachery. Agreeing is no betrayal. The real betrayal would be to let violence take the place of democracy in Northern Ireland again.

But I want to do more than keep our promises. I sense the British people demand more of us, too. People ask me the highlight of the election. Mine was driving from home to Buckingham Palace, along streets we had driven hundreds of times, past soulless buildings and sullen faces on their way to work. This drive was so different. As we turned into Gower Street, people watching our journey on TV came pouring out of the doorways, waving and shouting and clapping, with an energy and excitement that went beyond anything I imagined would happen. They were liberated. Theirs were the smiles of tolerant, broad-minded, outward-looking, compassionate people and suddenly they learned that they were in the majority after all. As one woman put it to me: ‘We’ve got our Government back.’ And with them I could sense confidence returning to the British people, compassion to the British soul, unity to the British nation, and that all three would give us new-found strength. The people were yearning for change in their country, at a time when they could see we had had the guts to modernise our party. The two came together. The result is a quiet revolution now taking place. Led by the real modernisers - the British people.

The size of our victory imposes a very special responsibility on us. To be a government of high ideals and hard choices. Not popular for one time but remembered for all time. Not just a better government than the Tories but one of the great, radical, reforming Governments of our history. To modernise Britain as we modernised the Labour Party. To build a Britain, not for a few, but for all the people. And it will require change. Hard choices. I know this country can make them if we show how and why.

The British don’t fear change. We are one of the great innovative peoples. From the Magna Carta to the first Parliament to the industrial revolution to an empire that covered the world; most of the great inventions of modern times with Britain stamped on them: the telephone; the television; the computer; penicillin; the hovercraft; radar. Change is in the blood and bones of the British we are by our nature and tradition innovators, adventurers, pioneers. As our great poet of renewal and recovery, John Milton, put it, we are ‘A nation not slow or dull, but of quick, ingenious and piercing spirit, acute to invent, subtle and sinewy to discourse, not beneath the reach of any point that human capacity can soar to.’

Even today, we lead the world, in design, pharmaceuticals, financial services, telecommunications. We have the world’s first language. Britain today is an exciting, inspiring place to be. And it can be much more. If we face the challenge of a world with its finger on the fast forward button; where every part of the picture of our life is changing. Today I say to the British people: the chains of mediocrity have broken, the tired days are behind us, we are free to excel once more. We are free to build that model 21st Century nation, to become that beacon to the world.

Creative. Compassionate. Confident of our place in the world.

And when people say sorry, that’s too ambitious, it can’t be done, I say: this is not a sorry country, we are not a sorry people. It can be done. We know what makes a successful creative economy. Educate the people. Manage the country’s finances well. Encourage business and enterprise. But each bit requires us to modernise and take the hard choices to do it. We have been a mercantile power. An industrial power. Now we must be the new power of the information age. Our goal: to make Britain the best educated and skilled country in the world; a nation, not of a few talents, but of all the talents. And every single part of our schools system must be modernised to achieve it.

Nearly 40 per cent of 11 year olds can’t read, write or add up properly. 42nd in the world education league. This is the scandalous legacy not just of 18 years of Tory Government but of a country too often content to educate the elite and ignore education for all. Education, education, education. Remember? In just 5 months, we made a remarkable beginning, under the brilliant leadership of David Blunkett. But we will do more.

Equipping our schools

We are publishing today details of agreements involving Government and the private sector, for the biggest public/private partnership in any education system, anywhere in the world, which will mean:

By 2002 every one of the 32,000 schools in Britain will have modern computers, the educational programmes to go on them, the teachers skilled to teach on them, the pupils skilled to use them, connected to the superhighway for free and with phone bills slashed to as low as £1 per pupil per year.

We are setting a new target of £2 billion for this parliament for our school repairs and equipment programme. A list of the first 2,300 schools to benefit is being published today. The money is being allocated today. One of the head-teachers is here with us. By 2002 up to 10,000 schools will have benefited.

Getting the basics right

We are launching the biggest assault on poor literacy and numeracy standards this country has seen. We are setting a target of 80% up to the standard in literacy, 75% for numeracy by the year 2002, and we’ll keep on until every 11 year old in every school in every part of Britain gets the start in life that they deserve. And I repeat the promise I made at the election, that over the lifetime of this parliament, we will reverse the Tory policy of cutting spending on education as a proportion of our national income and raise it once again, beginning with £1billion extra next year.

Nursery vouchers have gone and instead we’ll get nursery places for all four year olds and we’re on the way to places for all three year olds too. The money will be there, but in return hard choices and modernisation. No failure. No muddling through. No second best. High standards. The pursuit of excellence. Discipline and leadership. Support from home. Not for some children in some schools. But for all children in all schools. Each school that needs it, and every LEA, will be set targets for improvement. Failing schools and LEAs will be taken over. Teacher training will be reformed. Head teachers will have a proper qualification. Poor teachers will go.

People say my job’s pressurised. So is teaching. And don’t let anybody think that we are tough on bad teaching because we don’t value teachers. We are tough on bad teachers precisely because we DO value good teachers who need high quality teachers working alongside them. And parents have to play their part. There will be home school contracts for all pupils. Sign them. There will be new measures to tackle truancy and disruptive children, new homework requirements. Support them. When a school disciplines a child, back the teacher. The high ideal of the best schools in the world. Reached through hard choices.

Universities in Britain had their funding cut by 40% per student under the Tories. The science and research base - once the envy of the world - under threat. The Tories put a cap on student numbers. Only 30% of youngsters in Britain admitted to go to university. Fewer not just than France or the USA, but fewer than South Korea. The hard choice: stay as we are and decline. Or modernise and win. Under our proposals, no parent will have to pay more. Low income families will be entirely exempt from tuition fees. All students will repay only as they can afford to.And if we reform, I am going to pledge to you, that by the end of this parliament, we will put resources saved through reform into frontline provision in universities and further education; and the first 165 million pounds is already in next year’s budgets. We will lift the cap on student numbers and set a target for an extra 500,000 people into higher and further education by 2002. Our education system - a beacon to the world.

Within days of taking office, we took one of the hardest choices of all: we gave the Bank of England the right to decide interest rates and take the politics out of mortgages. And in the short term it’s tough. Interest rates have gone up. But I say to people, better to go up now, still only by 1%, than to go back to the days of the last Tory government when mortgages were at 15% for a year, 1 million homes in negative equity, a whole swathe of industry wiped out. We are cutting the Tory deficit too. We are sorting out the public finances. Borrow only for investment. Hold debt down. Earn before you spend. Don’t live on tick. I want this to be the New Labour Government that ended Tory boom and bust for ever.

Twenty years ago, the IMF came to bury us. Now they come to praise us. Yes, new Labour’s got new friends everywhere. I want Britain to be a country of enterprise and ambition where small businesses grow, manufacturing and engineering revive, where we learn the lessons of British industrial relations over the past 100 years. Fairness at work yes. But flexibility will remain. For business, this will be a Government on your side not in your way. And I say to both sides of industry, there is no place for militant trade unionism or uncaring management today. Partnership is the key. That is the only language this New Labour Government will respect.

It’s pretty simple the type of country I want. It’s a country where our children are proud and happy to grow up in, feeling good not just about themselves, but about the community around them. I don’t want them living in a country where some of them go to school, hungry, unable to learn because their parents can’t afford to feed them; where they can see drugs being traded at school gates; where gangs of teenagers hang around street corners, nothing to do, but spit and swear and abuse passers-by; I don’t want them brought up in a country where the only way pensioners can get long-term care is by selling their home, where people who fought to keep that country free are now faced every winter with the struggle for survival, skimping and saving, cold and alone, waiting for death to take them. And I will not rest until that country is gone and all our children live in a Britain where no child goes hungry, the young are employed, and the old are cherished and valued to the end of their days.

But let me spell out some facts. After eighteen years of Tory Government, of cuts and closures, of declining public services, the country was taxed more than under the last Labour Government. This country, any country, will not just carry on paying out more in taxes and getting less. Our new society will have the same values as it ever did. Fighting poverty and unemployment. Securing justice and opportunity. It should be a compassionate society. But it is compassion with a hard edge. A strong society cannot be built on soft choices. It means fundamental reform of our welfare state, of the deal between citizen and society. It means getting money out of social breakdown and into schools and hospitals where we want to see it.

The new welfare state must encourage work, not dependency. We are giving young people and the long-term unemployed the opportunity. A £3.5 billion investment. We are adding today the option of self employment as part of the new deal. But they have to take one of the options on offer. We want single mothers with school age children at least to visit a job centre, not just stay at home waiting for the benefit cheque every week until the children are sixteen. Modern welfare means a better balance between public and private money. We need to invest more as a country in savings and pensions. But government’s role is going to be to organise provision - like new stakeholder pensions not fund it all through ever-higher taxes. And our number one duty is to get help to the poorest pensioners first.

Housing benefit, in some areas, is virtually designed for fraud. It has to change. We will not be that beacon to the world in the year 2005 with a welfare state built for the very different world of 1945. Our tax system should reward hard work. In the 80s the Tories took down high marginal tax rates for high earners. It is time we did the same for Britain’s working poor.

And the same drive for reform applies to the NHS. I’m tired of hearing the NHS described as if it were a relic. It isn’t. It was the greatest act of modernisation any Labour Government ever did. My vision is not just to save the NHS but make it better. The money will be there. I promise you that. This year. Every year. Millions saved from red tape, millions more into breast cancer treatment already. The values will remain. From next April, the two-tier NHS of the Tories will go. And I tell you. I will never countenance an NHS that departs from its fundamental principle of health care based on need not wealth. The hospitals will be built. 14 of them, the biggest hospital building programme in the history of the NHS. It will mean an extra £1.3 billion in 14 towns and cities serving 5 million people. And as of today, it is 15.

But money is not the only problem with healthcare in Britain. The NHS itself needs modernisation and hard choices.We appointed the first Minister for Public Health because the NHS should not lose millions every year because of avoidable illnesses like those from smoking. Barriers between GPs, social services and hospitals must be broken down. Hospitals cannot stand still. Increasingly, general hospitals will provide routine care, supported by specialist centres of excellence in treatment, research and education. GPs and nurses will do more of what hospitals used to do, often working on the same site in partnership with chemists, dentists, opticians and physiotherapists.

New technology offers huge opportunities in healthcare but we haven’t yet begun to seize them properly. We will get the money in. But in return, I want reform. From next April, there will be up to ten specially-funded Health Action Zones set up in Britain. Their remit: to experiment with new ideas in the way healthcare is delivered, so that patients get a better deal from their health service for the 21st century. The NHS was a beacon to the world in 1948. I want it to be so again. It will always be safe with us. But I want it to be better with us.

I say to the country in all honesty. You can have the education revolution, the health revolution, the welfare revolution. But it means hard choices. It means us all getting involved. And it means modernisation. And we need to bring a change to the way we treat each other. I tell you: a decent society is not based on rights. It is based on duty. Our duty to each other. To all should be given opportunity, from all responsibility demanded. The duty to show respect and tolerance to others. I make no apology. I back zero tolerance on crime. I back powers to tackle anti-social neighbours; to make parents responsible for their children; to overhaul the youth justice system so that youngsters stop thinking they can commit a crime, get a caution and carry on being a criminal. At every level of the fight against crime - today acting on serious organised crime - this New Labour Government is taking it on. It will take time. And it will be tough. But to those who say it’s all a threat to our civil liberties, I say the threat to civil liberties is of women afraid to go out, and pensioners afraid to stay at home, because of crime and the fear of crime, and we’re going to help them.

And we cannot say we want a strong and secure society when we ignore its very foundation: family life. This is not about preaching to individuals about their private lives. It is addressing a huge social problem. Attitudes have changed. The world has changed. But I am a modern man leading a modern country and this is a modern crisis. Nearly 100,000 teenage pregnancies every year. Elderly parents with whom families cannot cope. Children growing up without role models they can respect and learn from. More and deeper poverty. More crime. More truancy. More neglect of educational opportunities. And above all more unhappiness. I give you this pledge. Every area of this Government’s policy will be scrutinised to see how it affects family life. Every policy examined, every initiative tested, every avenue explored to see how we strengthen our families and there will be a Ministerial group to drive it through.

Don’t think we’re asking everyone to change but not Government itself. We will publish a White Paper in the new year for what we call Simple Government, to cut the bureaucracy of Government and improve its service. We are setting a target that within five years, one quarter of dealings with Government can be done by a member of the public electronically through their television, telephone or computer. Our politics are being reformed. We will deliver the Scottish Parliament and the Welsh Assembly after one hundred years of trying, and I say to the House of Lords, before it is reformed, don’t try to wreck this legislation: we have the votes of the people, you’ve got the votes of nobody.

We will have a strategic authority and elected Mayor for London if the people vote for it. I can announce to you we are going to bring forward a Bill to ban foreign donations to political parties and to compel all parties to make contributions above £5,000 public. And we will ask the Nolan Committee to look at the wider question of Party funding. At the next election all political parties will at last compete on a level playing field. And I know some of you are a bit nervous about what I am doing with the Liberal Democrats. Though not half as nervous as they are. Since this is a day for honesty, I’ll tell you: my heroes aren’t just Ernie Bevin, Nye Bevan and Attlee. They are also Keynes, Beveridge, Lloyd George. Division among radicals almost one hundred years ago resulted in a 20th century dominated by Conservatives. I want the 21st century to be the century of the radicals.

We cannot be a beacon to the world unless the talents of all the people shine through. Not one black High Court Judge; not one black Chief Constable or Permanent Secretary. Not one black Army officer above the rank of Colonel. Not one Asian either. Not a record of pride for the British establishment. And not a record of pride for the British Parliament that there are so few black and Asian MPs. I am against positive discrimination. But there is no harm in reminding ourselves just how much negative discrimination there is.

On taking office, we discovered that the last Government planned to cut from £83m to £43m the Home Office section 11 budget and make redundant 7,000 teachers and classroom assistants who help children for whom English is a second language. Today I announce; that Tory cut will not stand. I’ll tell you why. That money is not a cost, it is an investment. And it’s one a civilised nation should make. A nation tolerant and open. Free from prejudice but not from rules. A beacon for good at home and abroad. There is huge interest in Britain now. Because people know that this is a country changing for the better. A go-ahead place. The gates of xenophobia falling down. This Government can be the Government of enlightened patriotism.

Again my vision for post-Empire Britain is clear. It is to make this country pivotal, a leader in the world. To use the strengths of our history to build our future. With the US our friend and ally. Within the Commonwealth. In the United Nations. In NATO. To use the superb reputation of our Armed Forces, not just for defence, but as an instrument of influence in a world of collective security and cooperation. And to lead in Europe again. Not so that we ‘don't get left behind.’ That is a weak reason. It is because for four centuries or more, we have been a leading power in Europe. And we have at times been absolutely critical to the survival of not just Europe but the world. It is our destiny.

And Europe needs us. For we have a vision of Europe. We want a people’s Europe: free trade, industrial strength, high levels of employment and social justice, democratic. Against that vision is the bureaucrat’s Europe: the Europe of thwarting open trade, unnecessary rules and regulations, the Europe of the C.A.P. and the endless committees leading nowhere. But we cannot shape Europe unless we matter in Europe. I know there will be a hard choice to come over a single currency. And our policy, based on the British national interest, remains unchanged. But in or out, we will be affected by it and must remain able to influence the way it works. Next year Britain now takes on the Presidency of the EU and it will do so as, once again, a respected leading European nation. That is an achievement of the new Labour government of which I am proud.

And elsewhere too, new respect and influence. In tackling Third World debt. On the environment. Today in London the Government’s Chief Scientific Adviser is issuing a report on global warming which I commissioned on coming into government. Read it and you will see why I am so passionate in my commitment to action not just in Britain but throughout the world, which is why we will take that action and get the rest of the world to take that action too. So much to do. So much to change. So hard to do it. But the vision is as old as humanity.

Modernisation is not an end in itself. It is for a purpose.

Modernisation is not the enemy of justice, but its ally.

Progress and justice are the two rocks upon which the New Britain is raised to the heights. Lose either one and we come crashing down until we are just another average nation, scrabbling around for salvation in the ebbing tide of the 20th Century.

That is why we changed the Labour Party. To make New Britain. It is why we will carry on changing. It is why it was right yesterday to take another historic step on the road to reform of our Party so that never again will a Labour government be torn about by divisions between leadership in Parliament and Party in the country. Yes, we are New Labour. Yes, our policies and attitudes have changed. But there are no Old Labour or New Labour values. There are Labour values. They are what make us the Party of compassion; of social justice; of the struggle against poverty and inequality; of liberty; of basic human solidarity; and the day we cease to be those things is the day we keep the name of the Labour Party but lose the reason for its existence. And these are indeed the best of British values too. The point of modern Britain is not to dishonour the past. But to honour it by improving it, by taking the best of it and adding to it. Ours is a simple enough vision. But it will require a supreme national effort. It is a task for a whole people, not just a government.

Great challenges

But great rewards for all of us if we rise to them as we can. As one nation. Held together by our values and by the strength of our character. We are a giving people. In the face of crisis or challenge we pull together, strengthened by unity. It says nothing about our politics. It speaks volumes about our character. You remember how your parents, like mine, used to say to you: Just do your best. Well let’s do our best.

On May 1, the people entrusted me with the task of leading their country into a new century. That was your challenge to me. Proudly, humbly, I accepted it. Today, I issue a challenge to you. Help us make Britain that beacon shining throughout the world. Unite behind our mission to modernise our country. There is a place for all the people in New Britain, and there is a role for all the people in its creation. Believe in us as much as we believe in you. Give just as much to our country as we intend to give. Give your all. Make this the giving age. ‘By the strength of our common endeavour we achieve more together than we can alone.’

On 1st May 1997, it wasn’t just the Tories who were defeated. Cynicism was defeated. Fear of change was defeated. Fear itself was defeated. Did I not say it would be a battle of hope against fear? On 1st May 1997, fear lost. Hope won. The Giving Age began.

Now make the good that is in the heart of each of us, serve the good of all of us. Give to our country the gift of our energy, our ideas, our hopes, our talents. Use them to build a country each of whose people will say that ‘I care about Britain because I know that Britain cares about me.’ Britain, head and heart, can be unbeatable. That is the Britain I offer you. That is the Britain that together can be ours."

Mr. Udovenko said the Secretary-General's programme for reform would be at the centre of the session. It was a sound basis for further deliberations by the Assembly. As President, he would encourage action-oriented discussion on the measures and proposals for United Nations reform. Calling on all Member States to facilitate the reform process and to building a broad consensus, he said the success of reform depended on their political wisdom and their will to act promptly, constructively and decisively.
Noting that, recently, the Organization had come under heavy criticism, he said not all of it was unjustified. Despite all its shortcomings, the United Nations remained a unique and indispensable mechanism for addressing new challenges, including those related to international peace and security and to promoting sustained economic growth and sustainable development.

Schroeder pledged to put Germany back to work and give the nation a new optimism.
German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder arrives at parliament, prepared for another historical event in German politics.
In his inaugural address to parliament, Schroeder said he would modernize Europe's biggest economy and promote private initiative.
He was also keen to put new emphasis on a government that promises to provide for society's weakest members.
He stressed that the economic situation and the high unemployment rate needed the efforts of all social forces.
Unions and employers were again invited to help form a ""union for employment', as independent government measures would not be enough to spark off the reform process needed.
""The one single measure to solve the problems - that's something that doesn't exist. Tax policy, reducing fees, future investments and wage policy have to fit together. Only if all
economic forces work together can sustainable employment develop.""
That theme, touted by some in Europe's new left as the ""Third Way"" between pure capitalism and a strong social welfare state, helped the younger Schroeder unseat longtime leader Helmut Kohl in September.
Schroeder also said he intended to strengthen the European Union, pushing it more towards a political union.
""The integration of Germany into the European Union is of salient meaning for the German policy. The government will therefore specifically use the German EU council leadership in the first half year of 1999 to gain political union. Only by further developing we will succeed to build a Europe that will have a close relationship with its citizens.""
Again Schroeder said Germany would continue to take part in international peace missions organised by the U-N.
The German parliament will discuss a current deployment to Kosovo later on Tuesday, but will transfer the discussion process to the parliament commission for foreign policy.
A parliamentary vote is expected for Friday.
""We want to further build up and use the instruments of the common European foreign and security policy. That's also something our friends overseas are waiting for with impatience. German foreign policy has been and will be a peace policy. And we declare our will to take part in actions and missions to secure and stabilize peace. This is especially valid for the situation in Southeast Europe (the Balkan).""
After outlining all the main goals set by his Social Democrats and their junior coalition partner, the ecology-minded Greens, Schroeder finished his speech with optimistic words.
""We will make it, because we believe in Germany's power""
Schroeder is the first Social Democrat Chancellor in Germany after 16 years of conservative domination by the Christian Democrats.
Together with their junior political partners the Greens, Social Democrats have a 21 seat majority in Parliament."
10308,"Didier Opertti, PGA Inauguration Speech",http://undocs.org/en/A/53/PV.107,Didier Opertti,President of the General Assembly,Inauguration Speech,1998,,"The President (spoke in Spanish): I see the session of the General Assembly that is closing today, the penultimate session of this century, as a preparatory exercise in meeting the problems awaiting us with the arrival of the new century — in other words, problems that are already here. It is a century that, on the one hand, shows both promising and disturbing signs and appears to be marked by the existence of serious contradictions that, in turn, are the major challenges to which mankind must continue to respond. In our view, those contradictions take primarily three aspects. First, the world continues to move towards the most complete achievement of individual freedoms and towards the democratization of national societies and the international community. Despite the fact that much remains to be done, it is true that never before in history have the ideals of democracy and freedom achieved such broad application, or at least recognition, as they have now. However, the progress made in this field has not done away with violence aimed at imposing the ideals and purposes of heightened nationalism, religious fundamentalism or supposed ethnic supremacy. The fact that in the past ten years only a half dozen of the more than 100 conflicts that have affected international peace and security were territorial conflicts clearly shows the kind of problem we will be facing in the future. During the 12 months since the Assembly began its fifty-third session, violence in vast regions of the world has dominated and affected people’s lives, in many cases depriving them of life and hence generating a legacy of fear and, in many cases, rancour in the hearts of human beings. These events categorically disprove the prophecies of those who have predicted the end of history. In Europe, Africa and Asia old and new conflicts continue to call for the attention of the international community and increasingly cry out for the adoption of attitudes and signs of solidarity inspired by tolerance. Naturally, the world is not a homogeneous place. There are regions where peace prevails and where there is agreement and where peaceful settlement of controversies takes place. Clear proof of this has been offered by our region — Latin America and the Caribbean — where certain historical conflicts among States were brought to a peaceful end in the course of this year. I cite this fact with undisguised pride, while at the same time not failing to note clearly our brotherly worry over the internal situation that prevails in some of those States. The African continent has been particularly affected by various factors, some due to nature and others to the activities of man. The General Assembly has given particular attention to this situation. Proof of this was the adoption by consensus of a resolution on the causes of conflict and the promotion of durable peace and sustainable development in Africa, which set out the main principles for providing assistance to the continent. The General Assembly must persist in its efforts to assist our African brothers to overcome this situation of crisis and underdevelopment in which they have been placed as a result of a history of colonialism and discrimination. The prevailing political conditions in the Middle East during the session ending today were not the most propitious for advancing the peace process. The General Assembly dealt with the various aspects of this complex problem in the hopes that the situation would develop along more favourable lines. Fortunately, this appears to be the situation today. I therefore trust that during the coming session the Assembly will be able to adopt significant decisions that will contribute to consolidating a lasting and just peace in the region. But it has undoubtedly been the conflict in Kosovo — because of its magnitude and consequences — that has been the most important international political event of the year. Allow me here to express some of my personal views. I see it as a lamentable coincidence that during the year I was chosen to preside over the General Assembly the credibility and efficacy of this body, which is the most genuinely democratic and representative body of the international community, has been subjected by that conflict to the harshest test in its history. The conflict in Kosovo brought to light several aspects that I cannot fail to mention. First, it showed that the Security Council, whose commitment is to the preservation of peace, has been kept from pursuing that commitment by virtue of the fact that it was not able to agree on decisions in this matter. The possibility of using the veto played its role, showing that this mechanism supposedly conceived to, among other things, avoid the use of force, has ultimately led to its being an enabling factor in removing the use of force from the Council and, hence, from the entire Organization. Secondly, it is necessary to recall that the General Assembly, which, under the Charter, in particular Articles 10 and 11, is competent to deal with the maintenance of international peace and security, has not been in a position to exercise that competence — not because of a lack of a legal framework but because the predominant political will was that it should not make use of that capacity. In the past that responsibility was assumed by this body when the Security Council was kept from acting in situations that threatened or breached peace. On those occasions, the international community formally declared that the inability of the Security Council to discharge its functions did not deprive the General Assembly of its rights or relieve it of its responsibilities under the Charter. Finally, let us recall that the Charter is based on the principle of legitimacy, which provides a basis and raison d’etre for the entire international legal order. As a result, the most important lesson we must learn from the case of Kosovo is that we should continue diligently to seek ways to fully guarantee respect for that principle of legitimacy. It may be premature to make a conclusive assessment of the Kosovo crisis, but it is clear that it has affected and will affect the functioning and credibility of this Organization. Perhaps the only positive element of that conflict is that it has clearly shown that any further delay in reforming the United Nations cannot be allowed or justified. I hope that resolution 53/30, adopted by the General Assembly last December during the current session, on the majority required to make any changes in relation to the Security Council, will facilitate an acceleration of the process of reform. As for the current worrying situation in East Timor, we must hope that this time United Nations mechanisms will work effectively and an end will be put to the violations of human rights that are taking place in that region. The results achieved at this session in the sphere of disarmament and arms limitation can be considered encouraging given the context in which the negotiations took place. Among the various resolutions adopted, I should like to highlight the one relating to the convening of an international conference on the illicit trade in weapons in all its aspects, including small arms and light weapons. The entry into force last March of the Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-personnel Mines and on Their Destruction is a comforting indication that there is a general aversion to such cruelly indiscriminate weapons. Peacekeeping operations have received particular attention in the General Assembly during this session. The financing of various such missions was approved, including the complex Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo. Furthermore, on the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of the establishment of peacekeeping, the international community paid tribute to this indispensable instrument of peace and to the men and women who have taken part in it and in many cases given their lives in this endeavour. The year of the fiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights was one of great activity for the General Assembly. Among the various resolutions adopted, I should like to highlight the one by which the General Assembly adopted the Declaration on the Right and Responsibility of Individuals, Groups and Organs of Society to Promote and Protect Universally Recognized Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. The adoption of that Declaration after 13 years of negotiation is an important new milestone in the process of consolidating and improving the international system for the protection of human rights. Above all, through the resolution adopted last December on the Statute of the International Criminal Court, at this session the General Assembly joined in the search for the most effective measures to ensure the international protection of human rights and to bring to justice those who violate them. In that resolution the Assembly recognized the historic importance of the Statute and adopted measures for setting up the Court and setting it under way. That was the best way to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the cornerstone of one of the most inspired and momentous political and institutional creations of the twentieth century. The second major contradiction to which I should like to refer relates to technological progress, to the revolution in communications and transportation and to the extraordinary expansion of scientific knowledge, which have led humankind to unprecedented levels of material development. But the benefits of this progress are distributed unequally among the various sectors of humanity. This has produced a disturbing split, caused by the fact that the technological explosion is taking place in the developed countries, where a lesser portion of the world’s population lives, while elsewhere a demographic explosion is accompanied by an acute technological deficit. As a result, in a world that is increasingly small and interdependent, we have the dangerous coexistence of prosperous and technologically advanced societies with populations living in conditions of poverty and insecurity. The process of globalization does not, on its own, help resolve this contradiction. On the contrary, it is generally accepted that the rapid acceleration of globalization in recent years, resulting from the opening of markets and the liberalization and modernization of trade, may well heighten social differences and economic contradictions in international society as well as within national societies. If we do not rapidly take effective measures to correct the negative effects of that process, the threats of social disintegration will become increasingly real and disturbing, and the possibility of establishing stability and lasting peace even more remote. The uncertainty resulting from this process that we are witnessing led to our holding, at the beginning of this session, a high-level discussion on the economic and social impact of globalization and interdependence and their political consequences. On that occasion, it became clear that there was great interest on the part of Governments, international bodies and civil society in this area. In order to continue to deepen our consideration of this phenomenon, which affects the lives of all present and future inhabitants of the planet, we must adopt rules for clarification and guidance. In the dynamic context of growing globalization and interdependence, the United Nations is called upon to play a fundamental role as the body promoting cooperation and guidance for development. The General Assembly assumed that responsibility when it adopted the important resolution entitled “Role of the United Nations in promoting development in the context of globalization and interdependence”. The question has remained open for analysis and consideration by Governments. It is to be hoped that we will adopt as soon as possible specific measures that will ensure that the benefits of globalization are distributed equally and in particular that we will avoid marginalizing developing countries and reduce their vulnerability. Of equal importance and closely related to this matter is the resolution on the financial crisis and its impact on growth and development, especially in the developing countries. In this resolution, the Assembly, inter alia, has stressed the need to strengthen and improve mechanisms to prevent, manage and solve international financial crises and proposes measures most effectively to address these issues and to mitigate their negative effects on the development prospects of developing countries. The third and last major contradiction to which I wish to refer arises from the fact that while, in many societies, a high level of social integration has been achieved, with high levels of knowledge, culture and creative activities, those same societies appear nevertheless to be extremely vulnerable to such dangers as drug trafficking, organized crime, terrorism and environmental degradation. It is among the capacities of this Assembly to establish defences against these enemies — the United Nations has indeed been involved in this task — and to carry out a vigorous educational campaign to contribute to developing a culture of health, a culture of legality and a culture of environmental conservation. There is no greater cause of environmental degradation than poverty. The grave concern of Governments regarding the negative impact that current economic trends may well have on social development has been seen at this session on an ongoing basis. Prompted by this concern, the Assembly has adopted several resolutions on important social issues, among which I would mention those on international cooperation to address the world drug problem, on transnational international crime, the situation of women and the rights of the child and refugees, among others. I must also highlight the convening of the twenty-first special session of the General Assembly to assess the further implementation of the Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development. This event was evidence of the democratization and universalization of information and knowledge in this sphere. It reaffirmed the will of the international community to continue to address questions of population and development that are affected by decisions in the spheres of science, culture and tradition, considering all as ineluctable aspects of the same problem. That problem, ultimately, must be solved at the human level with a responsible use of freedom. Finally, without claiming to have drafted an exhaustive list, I wish to refer to the resolutions on decolonization, cooperation in the peaceful uses of outer space, questions related to information — in particular the resolution reaffirming a series of principles and guidelines for international negotiations. I consider of particular importance the resolution on dialogue among civilizations and the resolution by which the Declaration and Programme of Action on a Culture of Peace was adopted earlier today. Both are cornerstones on which the international community can in the future build an ethical legal system to govern future relations among States and peoples. The ethical content of that commitment is an element which, in my view, is unavoidable. The Millennium Summit, to be held at the fifty-fifth session of the General Assembly to begin in September 2000 — in preparation of which a great deal of work has been done at this fifty-third session — will provide a unique opportunity to consider the role which the United Nations is to play in the new century. In this connection, I am pleased to note that, at this session, intensive negotiations have been held on this issue, thanks to which substantive progress has been made towards determining the format of the meeting and the bases or content of that important event. I have no doubt that, on the basis of this work, the preparations for the Summit will be successfully completed at the fifty-fourth session. In short, at its fifty-third session, the General Assembly considered a total of 170 items at 107 plenary meetings and nine informal meetings. It adopted 309 resolutions — 248 by consensus — and 130 decisions. The variety and importance of the questions discussed at this session ending today and the earnest and constructive spirit in which they were considered show that, because of its representativeness, its universality, its capacity to listen and to see things from all angles, the United Nations continues to be the sole and central forum for pursuing global dialogue on the fundamental world problems facing mankind. This is the unshirkable role which we must continue to play in the future of conflicts awaiting us in the new millennium. To do this effectively will depend on two factors. First, the Organization must have the necessary financial resources to fulfil its commitments. In this regard, it is to be hoped that the major debtor States of this Organization will pay their international financial obligations as soon as possible. Secondly, it will depend on our adopting the necessary reforms to make this institution capable of meeting new challenges and needs. We must step up our efforts to restore the primacy of the Organization in leading international affairs, particularly those affecting peace and security. We must strengthen and improve it, bringing its structure and functioning in line with the requirements of new needs and challenges. This, ultimately, does not depend on one or several us; it depends on each of us, on all of us. In the General Assembly, in recent years we have noted an effort along these lines that has continued throughout the session ending today. The general process of reform in the United Nations, which was invigorated at the last session, has continued under my presidency. The Assembly has continued to work primarily on the basis of ideas and proposals of the Secretary-General, to whom we reiterate our thanks and recognition for his genuine commitment to the cause of reform. The process of putting these initiatives into practice has been slower than it was at first. However, significant progress was achieved at this session in the sphere of the environment and human settlements through the adoption of a series of important measures and recommendations that will undoubtedly improve the functioning and efficiency of the Organization in this sphere. If, before assuming my responsibilities as President of this Assembly, I was convinced of the need to change the functioning of the main organs of the United Nations and their interrelationship, today, after a year of experience in this post, I am far more convinced of it than ever. I must confess that, more than once, I was surprised and even perplexed and pained to note that, despite sporadic contacts with their respective representatives, the organs with the major political responsibilities in the Organization — the Security Council and the General Assembly — act in isolation from one another, without coordination or transparency. Security Council reform is undoubtedly the most controversial element of the United Nations restructuring effort, and the one with the greatest political implications. The ambitious intention to transform the Council into a more representative, more democratic, more open, more transparent, and hence more effective body makes for an extraordinarily complex and delicate task that requires effort and time, enormous patience and firm political will from all participants in the exercise. We can now say that all of us, myself included, have invested great effort in this task and that we have given and received generous demonstrations of patience. But quite frankly, I do not perceive general true political will for reform that would facilitate agreement on the basic matters. Nonetheless, I am pleased to report that despite continuing deep differences on the fundamental elements of this matter, the Open-ended Working Group on the Question of Equitable Representation on and Increase in the Membership of the Security Council and Other Matters related to the Security Council succeeded in reaching agreement on certain basic, very general, ideas. Unlike earlier reports, the report adopted earlier this morning is not limited to a description of the programme of meetings and of the documents produced — a description necessary from the historical standpoint; it also indicated for the first time in seven years a consensus on some formal and substantive elements which, although modest, could be used in future discussions. Moreover, substantive progress was made on the Council’s working methods and on the transparency of its work. I must add that, in addition to the valuable oral statements made in the Working Group, many delegations responded to the Chairman’s invitation by setting out their positions in writing; these notes, along with the oral presentations, constitute valuable working material for future meetings of the Working Group. After 53 long and sometimes tense meetings of the Working Group, these results might well seem very meagre. But, looking at them from the proper perspective and considering the importance of the item and the fact that the vital interests of States are at stake, we can affirm, without making the error of excessive self-esteem or, worse, self-congratulation, that we have achieved limited but significant progress. After all, it is not by great leaps but by small and cautious steps like those taken at this session that we can cover the greatest distance and avoid the most obstacles. It is important also to note that during the meetings of the Working Group, we finally achieved, not without difficulty, a high level of substantive participation by delegations and of frankness in the expression of their views. To be sure, resolution 53/30, which requires a twothirds majority of Members of the General Assembly on any question relating to reform of the Security Council, allayed certain fears and eliminated certain misapprehensions that had had a negative effect on the work of the Group. It undoubtedly provides a solid basis for consolidating the spirit of trust needed to carry out the task of reforming the United Nations. Let me make a personal comment that I consider to be very important. Suggestions or proposals relating to working methods made by the Chairman were always based firmly on the fundamental principle, accepted from the very outset, of transparency in negotiations. It is to be hoped that mistrust — which at times, happily briefly, was nearly at the level of belligerence — will yield to greater flexibility in our discussions, without this ever implying that we should ignore the extremely high level of sensitivity and political importance involved in reform of the Charter. It remains for me to convey my deep and sincere thanks to all who accompanied me in the complex and at times arduous task of presiding over the work of the General Assembly. I know full well that I carried out that task well at times, reasonably well at other times, and not so well on occasion. But it was always my intention to perform well. I wish to acknowledge in particular the VicePresidents, especially those who were always ready to take the Chair when my presence was required elsewhere, including in my own country, whose Ministry of Foreign Affairs I continued to head. My thanks go also to the Chairmen, Vice-Chairmen and Rapporteurs of the Main Committees, to the coordinators of the various consultations and negotiations, and to the two Vice-Chairmen who worked with me in guiding the Open-ended Working Group on Security Council reform. As usual, the Secretariat fulfilled its responsibilities with the effectiveness to which Member States are accustomed. I wish publicly to thank the SecretaryGeneral and the staff of the Department of General Assembly Affairs and Conference Services, and the interpreters, translators, conference officers and security officers. The help I received from all who worked with me was even more valuable since throughout the year I continued to fulfil my responsibilities as Minister for Foreign Affairs of Uruguay, which is a member of the Latin American Integration Association and of the Southern Cone Common Market, as well as an active negotiator within the Free Trade Area of the Americas; all of these are responsibilities of the highest order for my country and for my region. Believe me when I say that I devoted maximal time and energy to respond properly to the trust placed in me a year ago by my regional group, the Group of Latin American and Caribbean States, to which my country is honoured to belong, and by all other members, by which I was highly honoured. I hope I did not let them down, but that is but a hope. As I leave you — representatives, colleagues, Secretariat staff — I want to express my sincerest wishes for the success of the next President."
10312,"Theo-Ben Gurirab, PGA Closing Speech",http://undocs.org/en/A/54/PV.100,Theo-Ben Gurirab,President of the General Assembly,Inauguration Speech,1999,,"The President: Distinguished delegates, ladies and gentlemen, we have now come to the end of the fifty-fourth session of the General Assembly, and it is time for me now to prepare handing over the gavel to my worthy successor. We had a unique and most memorable experience. It was the first-ever session of the General Assembly which straddled two centuries and two millenniums. Foremost among the most memorable things was the responsibility for preparing for the unprecedented United Nations Millennium Summit of heads of State or Government. The world will be witnessing the largest gathering of world leaders. This is really making history, and the final declaration will put meat on the bones. We held three special sessions. The first one was held in September last year, on small island developing States and their special needs. And the other two took place in June this year, one as a follow-up to the Fourth World Conference on Women, held at Beijing in 1995, and the other as a follow-up to the World Summit for Social Development, held at Copenhagen in 1995; these two special sessions took place in New York and in Geneva respectively. All three special sessions adopted action-oriented declarations and platforms for implementation, taking into consideration the outstanding progress already achieved by Member States and other key international and national stakeholders. I recommend that the fifthfifth session of the General Assembly pay close attention to these important outcome documents and give effect to their recommendations. We actively pursued the agenda of the Openended Working Group on the Question of Equitable Representation on and Increase in the Membership of the Security Council and Other Matters related to the Security Council. Regrettably, the debate is into its seventh year. Once again, it proved impossible for Member States to resolve the major sticking points, among them the admission of new permanent members, the exercise of the veto and some problematic procedural matters. There has, however, been some noticeable progress as regards the working methods of the Security Council. The Council has begun opening up its meetings to the other United Nations Member States as well as interacting informally with nongovernmental organizations. This openness and flexibility must be encouraged. The fundamental problem seems to be a manifest lack of political will on the part of some permanent members. In the light of this gridlock, which is unlikely to change in the foreseeable future, I am of the view that we should revisit the fixed position of a “package deal”. There are some new and creative ideas to move the debate forward. In the meantime, I hope that the growing sense of urgency among a large number of States about the need to reform, enlarge and democratize the Security Council will be embraced by all. I invite representatives to carefully study the latest report of the aforementioned working group. It contains practical proposals on the way forward. Moreover, pursuant to General Assembly resolutions 53/92 and 54/234, I established a working group to operationalize the implementation of the Secretary-General’s recommendations contained in his 1998 report on the causes of conflict and the consequences thereof in Africa. The working group has submitted specific proposals to overcome any bottlenecks, taking into account the outstanding recommendations of the Economic and Social Council. Those proposals are attached to the report that is now before the fifth-fifth session of the Assembly. On another, but related, issue, the Assembly also decided to convene in 2001 a critical intergovernmental conference on financing for development. This is a topical subject which is today at the core of the current debate on development, poverty eradication, debt cancellation, full employment and prosperity for all. I see it in the context of a global challenge which hinges on both political will and resource mobilization, something which I have talked about. In this context, I undertook setting up a bureau of the preparatory committee for that conference, and its planning activities have commenced in earnest. The participation in the forthcoming high-level conference by the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, the World Trade Organization, the United Nations Development Programme and other actors is indispensable from the word go. We need such partnerships in order to fulfil the goals and development plans of the United Nations. I commend the General Assembly for having launched what I consider to be a people-driven rescue operation. The United Nations Millennium Summit will start tomorrow in this Hall. It will indeed be a historic moment both for the United Nations and for humanity at large. By the time the general debate starts next week, we will be celebrating its outcome and paying tribute to the world leaders for their collective will for world peace, cooperation and development and for their reaffirmation of support for the United Nations. It was my privilege to have presided over the preparations for the Millennium Summit, and I want to thank all delegations for their cooperation in bringing the preparations to a successful conclusion. The Millennium Summit will adopt a final declaration. It is expected to be a politically authoritative document of historic import commensurate with the uniqueness of the Summit itself for all times. During the course of my presidency, I remained faithful to the mandate of the General Assembly, consistent with the United Nations Charter. I tried to give equal importance to all the agenda items and to those issues that came up from different sources, within the context of the mandate given to the Assembly. There were, however, certain matters that I felt needed extra emphasis because of what I considered to be their critical impact on the United Nations, its Member States and the world at large. Those issues included United Nations reform, humanitarian intervention, women’s rights, the plight of children, the HIV/AIDS pandemic, poverty eradication, the debt burden, financing for development, and enhancement of the authority and integrity of the General Assembly. I will elaborate on them on another occasion in my capacity as Namibia’s Foreign Minister. Earlier, I mentioned the protracted and frustrating United Nations reform process. I would like to reiterate my strong views in relation, in particular, to the functions and powers of the General Assembly. The Charter stipulates in various places encompassing and indisputable functions and powers of the Assembly. These qualities have been further enlarged significantly by subsequent United Nations resolutions and decisions, not excluding the role of the General Assembly in the field of peacekeeping and peace enforcement. During the past 12 months, I personally witnessed the extent to which the authority and integrity of the General Assembly continued to become the object of denigration as a way of currying favour with the other organs. I expressed my concerns on this subject in my acceptance speech last year. It is high time for the Member States, particularly the developing countries, to redress the persistent attacks on and marginalization of this foremost organ of the United Nations, the General Assembly. From 1960 onwards, the membership of the United Nations has grown by leaps and bounds, and now stands at 188. Today, it will become 189. The General Assembly is unlike any other body: it is the most representative, democratic, transparent and deliberative policy-making organ of all the United Nations. The real business starts here and ends here. This is one of the burning issues so close to my heart, and I will deal with it later. For now, my job is done. That is what I came for: nothing more, nothing less. But the General Assembly endures. And that is my imprimatur. I am not the first, and I will definitely not be the last, to renew the call for closer and more regularized cooperation, coordination and action among the principal officers of the General Assembly, the Security Council, the Economic and Social Council and the Secretariat. Such institutionalized, routinized and sustained interaction at the highest levels of our Organization will reinforce its capacity to measure success and ensure cost-effectiveness and efficiency throughout the system. This is absolutely vital at a time when rapidly changing international circumstances and challenges require one vision, one voice and joint action through the principal organs of the United Nations. I have not forgotten the others, but these four are at the centre of the day-to-day activities of our Organization. The United Nations faces challenging times in this century. One of the best ways to ensure its efficacy and performance is for it to be provided with sufficient resources and assured political support. To this end, Member States must pay their assessed and legally obligatory contributions on time, in full and without conditions. This matter has now become a bone of serious contention with serious political repercussions indeed for the United Nations. The current state of the Organization’s finances is precarious, and a lasting solution must be found urgently. During the fifty-fifth session of the General Assembly, Member States will deal once again with a lengthy agenda containing the whole gamut of critical challenges and current problems facing the United Nations. But we know only too well, do we not, that virtually all the debilitating and critical social issues in the world were short-listed, analysed and defined in specific programmes and plans of action a long time ago. We know this from the United Nations summits of the 1990s that sought to place before the Member States matters of public policy prioritizing and financing for development by the international community. The goals of that people-centred agenda remain intact. They are summed up in the words peace, development, resource mobilization and human security. If there is determined political will backed up by adequate financial resources, the developing countries and their poor masses will be well placed to deal effectively with the problems of education for all, gender equality, health care, childcare, poverty eradication, rural development, clean water and infrastructure building. I am saying that we all know exactly what the problems, needs and priorities of the poor are. What has been in short supply is the delivery of resources to engender sustainable social development. Over the last year, I spoke up at every opportunity on the heart-wrenching topic of the suffering of and deliberate violence against the world’s children, especially those trapped in armed conflict. I, together with so many other committed co-workers throughout the world, have tried to help sensitize the international community. I have used my office to raise the profile of this issue higher. I want to pay tribute to all United Nations agencies, organizations, offices and individuals the world over who have become part and parcel of this noble crusade. Their efforts to ensure a better, safer and more humane place for the sake of the leaders of the future and the repositories of human civilization — our children — will sustain this most sacred cause. Our children are tomorrow’s champions of dialogue, not of the clash of world civilizations, which make us different but yet unite us in diversity. We are one. We swim together or we sink together: the choice is ours. But saving children must come first. The General Assembly this year adopted a new Optional Protocol to the 1989 Convention on the Rights of the Child. This welcome achievement will further assist in the betterment of the welfare of children, their protection from child labour, from sexual exploitation, from destructive wars and from shameful pornography. While I am encouraged by the growing commitment by the Member States of the United Nations to safeguard and promote the well-being of children, quite a lot still remains to be done. The General Assembly must continue to remain vigilant in protecting our children and blame and shame by name and place their tormentors and accomplices. One of the most urgent challenges today is that of putting the needs of the people at the centre of the global agenda of peace and development and democracy. This is what I said in Geneva during the closing ceremony of the special session on social development. We must summon all the necessary political will, mobilize the requisite resources and focus on people-centred priorities to defeat poverty, hunger, want and fear from the face of the Earth once and for all. Compassion, generosity and sharing are noble virtues that should govern human relations. While the United Nations is not a perfect Organization, it is the only true, universal and representative international common home we have. It is here, and nowhere else, that we can together ensure world peace and development for the benefit of all. This must be our common hope and expectation from the United Nations Millennium Summit, which starts tomorrow in this majestic Hall of States and “We the Peoples”. I have a long roster of wonderful people to thank. I will happily do that in the fullness of time."
10317,"Harri Holkeri, PGA Closing Speech",http://undocs.org/en/A/55/PV.112,Harri Holkeri,President of the General Assembly,Inauguration Speech,2000,,"The President: As the fifty-fifth session of the General Assembly draws to a close, I feel deeply honoured and privileged to have served as its President. That this session was designated the Millennium Assembly of the United Nations, and that it was launched by the largest-ever gathering of world leaders and included the adoption of the historic Millennium Declaration, made my task a particular challenge. A year ago, I set prompt and effective follow-up to the Millennium Summit as one of the key priorities of my term. The Declaration was not to be left without attention worthy of its historic status. In December, the Assembly adopted a resolution outlining the follow-up action. Its emphasis was to call for maximum use of existing structures and upcoming conferences and events. For once, new mechanisms were not envisaged. During the past months, the Declaration has helped set the agenda and outcome of a series of major conferences. From the Conference on the Least Developed Countries through the special sessions on Habitat and HIV/AIDS and the recent conferences on small arms and racism, the Declaration has provided an important backdrop. For my part, I have underlined to each and every conference the importance of the Summit follow-up. I have also advocated an integrated approach in that follow-up. Such an approach should also be reflected in the road-map document prepared by the Secretariat, which is to be issued imminently. The United Nations is, however, still far from a truly integrated follow-up to the Summit. The same goes for the entire agenda of the last decade’s global conferences, which is too often approached on a piecemeal basis. Unfortunately, both Member States and the respective entities of the Secretariat seem to be unable to break the habit of viewing and considering different issues in isolation. Proper focus is needed, but in the overall context of the global agenda. To a great extent, the piecemeal approach results from lack of coordination. To improve coordination, my Office convened a series of meetings for representatives of the bureaux and secretariats of the various events so as to exchange information and help them learn from one another’s experiences. Even then, one was not able to avoid reinventing the wheel on a number of issues. This was particularly clear on the issue of civil society participation, where the Organization would clearly benefit from the adoption of more uniform modalities for major conferences. Having been involved in preparations and discussions, as well as having chaired special sessions and participated in different conferences, it has become evident to me that the Organization needs uniform modalities on civil society participation in conferences, now that civil society participation is so much a part of the everyday life of the United Nations. That brings me to the issue of civil society partnership — another theme that I have kept high on my agenda, in the spirit of the Millennium Declaration. I have advocated strengthened partnerships with civil society, including the private sector, for the Organization to be successful and relevant in the midst of the challenges of globalization. I would like to recognize the valuable work done by civil society, from the field to United Nations Headquarters, working towards the same universal goals as the Organization. During my term, civil society took an active and visible part in the work of two special sessions of the General Assembly and of the three United Nations conferences. To help delegations make sense of the differing modalities for civil society participation in major conferences, my Office put together a compendium of past practices. I also acted as a patron for a highly productive symposium on the issue of civil society partnerships. Responding to numerous requests from Member States, I have asked that both the compendium and the synopsis of that symposium be issued as official documents of the General Assembly. During the past year, I have attempted to gradually make the work of the General Assembly more effective and efficient. Many Members have come to know this through the small steps that I have taken. I have tried to be consistent and persistent, dispensing unhappiness in equal doses to all. However, the bigger issue is that the work of making the Assembly more relevant must be continued. If we cannot reform its agenda and its working methods, the General Assembly will continue to fall short of its potential. The reform resolution adopted just a few days ago must be seen as only a beginning in that respect. In particular, the work of the plenary must be reinvigorated. Furthermore, Member States must show greater restraint in requesting the inclusion of new items on its agenda; otherwise, the work of the plenary will eventually become clogged, and the institution itself irrelevant. The Office of the President of the General Assembly will also have to be given resources and servicing commensurate with its role. One of the observations that I made early on during my term was the lack of continuity from one presidency to the next. Even if the General Assembly secretariat provides services to the President, a core team of political officers — as called for by last Friday’s resolution — will be needed. That will ensure substantive backstopping and continuity, as well as a much-needed basis for networking with substantive departments. My attention was caught the other day by an advertisement which read, “Teamwork is spelled with two letters: W and E”. An organization like the United Nations should be all about teamwork and about a sense of “we”. There must be constant interaction between the Charter bodies, each one of them viewing the others as partners. I have had the good fortune of having a very good working relationship with the Secretary-General, and have pursued regular meetings with both the President of the Security Council and the President of the Economic and Social Council. This kind of interaction must be set on a well-established footing. In the spirit of dialogue and openness, I have also established the practice of holding regular monthly meetings with the chairpersons of the five regional groups to inform Member States about the work of the Assembly. To be self-sustaining, however, this kind of cooperation needs to include and have the full support of the Secretariat. I believe that an extra effort is needed within the Secretariat to this end. Pursuing dialogue and openness has also meant full transparency and accessibility. My doors have been open almost 24 hours a day and I have benefited enormously from the advice and knowledge that representatives have given to me. Maybe now that the President’s Office has been listed, at my request, in the United Nations phone directory — though only on page 243 — it will become even more accessible to Member States in the future. In pursuing transparency, I have tried to make maximum use of my web site. In addition to my statements and messages, a summary of my daily activities has been promptly posted on the web site. Coming from a small, open society, whose success can in great part be attributed to its openness, I am a great believer in the positive-sum effects of maximum openness in any organization. On the other reform issue, namely, that of the Security Council, I have tried to pursue comprehensive reform on different fronts. On day-to-day business, I have tried to enhance cooperation and coordination on common issues between the two Presidents through our monthly meetings. As President, I have also taken the step of addressing the Security Council on East Timor, a shared responsibility of both bodies. In the context of the Open-ended Working Group, as Chairman of that Group I have tried, together with my two able ViceChairpersons, to make progress in identifying the key aspects of the reform process. As President of the Assembly, I have been mandated to follow up the implementation of the Summit Declaration, and I believe that the Declaration implied that there is a renewed willingness to move forward on the reform. I approached the ministers for foreign affairs of Member States for their help in exploring the best ways to fulfil the mandate of the Millennium Declaration to intensify efforts to achieve a comprehensive reform of the Security Council in all its aspects. Based on the responses I have received from the ministers, I should like to make the following observations. All replies stressed the importance of Security Council reform, while recognizing its great sensitivity. In the light of the Summit outcome, many expressed their concern at the slow progress. There is a common recognition that the Council needs to reflect the realities of the twenty-first century to better serve the interests of peace and security. The foreign ministers also, of course, drew attention to specific aspects which they considered of particular importance. The main question, however, is how to fulfil the Summit mandate and move forward, after eight years of discussion, to a stage of negotiation. The response I received in this respect was multifaceted. There is a general agreement that the Working Group has made some progress and has had an effect on the working methods of the Security Council. But the main issues of the reform are still open. Many ministers stressed that while the Working Group has worked well as an initial discussion forum, the time may have come to consider other avenues that would advance this process. In this respect, three suggestions raised in the replies become critical. The first was the suggestion that discussion should be moved to a higher political level, be it a special session or high-level meeting, to enable us to generate sufficient political will to reach general agreement on this complex issue. The second suggestion was that while the goal must remain a comprehensive reform of the Security Council in all its aspects, Governments may want to consider approaching this goal in a focused way and move forward step by step, as we have done in the context of General Assembly reform. In any organization, reform can never be final; it is a continuous process aiming to adapt to changing circumstances. Thirdly, the scope of reform as defined in the Working Group’s agenda is gathering overwhelming support; hence, the question of the veto needs to be part of these discussions. Finally, all replies stressed that efforts for Security Council reform should continue. To sustain the impetus of the Millennium Summit and to resolve the stalemate, I urge all Member States to engage more actively in this process in order to move from discussion to negotiation. It should have a high priority on the agenda of the United Nations and its Member States, if we are to maintain the United Nations as the main actor in the maintenance and restoration of international peace and security. The elements are all discussed in the Open-ended Working Group, and the political will was demonstrated by the Millennium Declaration. We just have to bring them together. It is now up to the representatives of those very same Member States to turn that political will into reality and results. The United Nations cannot afford to fail in the reform of the Security Council. The Millennium Declaration is a manifestation by world leaders of global consensus and a shared vision and shared responsibility for the future of humankind. Our responsibility is a key dimension of globalization that, in my opinion, has been too often overlooked. One of the most important millennium targets is to halve the proportion of people living in extreme poverty, on less than $1 a day, by the year 2015. Several other millennium targets are intertwined with poverty and underline its cross-sectoral nature. To tackle poverty, we need to understand its multidimensional character and address all its root causes in a holistic manner. This cannot be left to markets and macroeconomics alone; neither should the speed of change force us to overemphasize the shortterm objectives. Attaining the millennium targets and eradicating poverty require a long-term vision to build human capital and sustainable people-centred development in communities and societies. The national Governments have the main responsibility for implementing the Declaration, but they cannot be left to handle this enormous task alone; the international community and the United Nations system must assist country-driven processes. In this regard, national and international policies and actions are mutually supportive. At all levels, people’s needs should guide our policy-making and discussions. The millennium agenda on peace and development presents a major policy challenge for both developed and developing countries. These goals are realistic and within our reach through partnership and cooperation. The global community has massive human, technical, technological and financial resources. Our awareness of the policies required is more advanced than ever. In this regard, the issue of development finance is critical and requires the participation of all ministers of finance in next year’s conference. We need to put into effect our strong political will and commitment, as demonstrated by the heads of State and Government at the Millennium Summit. It is my hope that this commitment will also guide the discussion when issues related to Africa are considered during the next session. Having visited the African continent twice during my tenure, and as Chairperson of the open-ended working group on Africa, I feel a special responsibility for development in Africa.
Since its adoption, I considered last December’s agreement on the new scale of assessments one of the highlights of the Assembly’s work this session. On the part of several delegations, it required painstaking efforts and a unique sense of vision about what would be in the best interest of the Organization. It was to put the Organization on a sounder financial footing. Lately, this optimism has become somewhat tempered. We are no longer sure whether the historic agreement will become reality in all its aspects. It would be catastrophic for the Organization if it were not. I therefore call on the largest contributor to act without delay in accordance with what was agreed upon, to which its Government has committed itself. Other key issues on our agenda that we were able to consider successfully included the important report by the Brahimi Panel on peacekeeping, and the subsequent comprehensive review of peacekeeping. We have also launched consideration of the conflict prevention report in all relevant organs of the United Nations, as well as by civil society, and the Assembly will come back to this issue some time next year. The consideration of these reports has reflected a high degree of willingness by Member States to help maintain the relevance of the United Nations. I truly hope that a most important mandate of the Organization, the maintenance of international peace and security, will continue to be high on the agenda of Member States. The many promises made during the Millennium Summit must be kept so that the Organization can meet the challenges it is facing with added resources and improved planning and preparedness. I wish to extend my sincerest gratitude to Member States for their constructive and pro-United Nations efforts during my term. Without their support, my agenda would have remained unfulfilled. I am convinced that this Organization remains, in the eyes of the vast majority of Member States, indispensable. My thanks also go to all of you individually. Both at the professional and at the personal level, I have been privileged to have the support and friendship of some of the finest people in the diplomatic service. I want to express my special thanks to the members of the General Committee, to the Chairpersons of the six Main Committees and to the Vice-Presidents of the Assembly, many of whom have presided over the plenary meetings in my absence. I also wish to give special recognition to the Vice-Chairmen of the openended working groups, as well as to my facilitators on various issues, in particular, the revitalization of the General Assembly. I also wish to extend my thanks to the Secretariat, from top to bottom. Mr. Secretary-General, you provide us with inspiration and encouragement and give a human face to this Organization. Your Deputy, whose position was created by the previous reform round, Ms. Fréchette, is indispensable to you in running this Organization, and she has shown great leadership even in difficult moments. Among the Under-Secretaries-General, a special tribute goes to Mr. Jin Yongjiang, who retired just a few weeks ago and returned to his native China. He and all of his team lent me invaluable support during these past 12 months. Finally, I wish to extend my very best wishes for success to my most esteemed successor, President designate of the fifty-sixth session of the General Assembly, Mr. Han Seung-soo, Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade of the Republic of Korea. I have no doubt that he will make an excellent President of the Assembly. I wish him well, and I once again thank you all.

10318,"George W. Bush, Presidential Inauguration Speech",https://avalon.law.yale.edu/21st_century/gbush1.asp,George W. Bush,President (United States),Inauguration Speech,2001,,"President Clinton, distinguished guests and my fellow citizens:

The peaceful transfer of authority is rare in history, yet common in our country. With a simple oath, we affirm old traditions and make new beginnings.

As I begin, I thank President Clinton for his service to our nation; and I thank Vice President Gore for a contest conducted with spirit and ended with grace.

I am honored and humbled to stand here, where so many of America's leaders have come before me, and so many will follow.

We have a place, all of us, in a long story. A story we continue, but whose end we will not see. It is the story of a new world that became a friend and liberator of the old, a story of a slave-holding society that became a servant of freedom, the story of a power that went into the world to protect but not possess, to defend but not to conquer. It is the American story. A story of flawed and fallible people, united across the generations by grand and enduring ideals. The grandest of these ideals is an unfolding American promise that everyone belongs, that everyone deserves a chance, that no insignificant person was ever born. Americans are called upon to enact this promise in our lives and in our laws; and though our nation has sometimes halted, and sometimes delayed, we must follow no other course.

Through much of the last century, America's faith in freedom and democracy was a rock in a raging sea. Now it is a seed upon the wind, taking root in many nations. Our democratic faith is more than the creed of our country, it is the inborn hope of our humanity, an ideal we carry but do not own, a trust we bear and pass along; and even after nearly 225 years, we have a long way yet to travel.

While many of our citizens prosper, others doubt the promise, even the justice, of our own country. The ambitions of some Americans are limited by failing schools and hidden prejudice and the circumstances of their birth; and sometimes our differences run so deep, it seems we share a continent, but not a country. We do not accept this, and we will not allow it. Our unity, our union, is the serious work of leaders and citizens in every generation; and this is my solemn pledge, ""I will work to build a single nation of justice and opportunity."" I know this is in our reach because we are guided by a power larger than ourselves who creates us equal in His image and we are confident in principles that unite and lead us onward.

America has never been united by blood or birth or soil. We are bound by ideals that move us beyond our backgrounds, lift us above our interests and teach us what it means to be citizens. Every child must be taught these principles. Every citizen must uphold them; and every immigrant, by embracing these ideals, makes our country more, not less, American.

Today, we affirm a new commitment to live out our nation's promise through civility, courage, compassion and character. America, at its best, matches a commitment to principle with a concern for civility. A civil society demands from each of us good will and respect, fair dealing and forgiveness. Some seem to believe that our politics can afford to be petty because, in a time of peace, the stakes of our debates appear small. But the stakes for America are never small. If our country does not lead the cause of freedom, it will not be led. If we do not turn the hearts of children toward knowledge and character, we will lose their gifts and undermine their idealism. If we permit our economy to drift and decline, the vulnerable will suffer most. We must live up to the calling we share. Civility is not a tactic or a sentiment. It is the determined choice of trust over cynicism, of community over chaos. This commitment, if we keep it, is a way to shared accomplishment.

America, at its best, is also courageous. Our national courage has been clear in times of depression and war, when defending common dangers defined our common good. Now we must choose if the example of our fathers and mothers will inspire us or condemn us. We must show courage in a time of blessing by confronting problems instead of passing them on to future generations.

Together, we will reclaim America's schools, before ignorance and apathy claim more young lives; we will reform Social Security and Medicare, sparing our children from struggles we have the power to prevent; we will reduce taxes, to recover the momentum of our economy and reward the effort and enterprise of working Americans; we will build our defenses beyond challenge, lest weakness invite challenge; and we will confront weapons of mass destruction, so that a new century is spared new horrors.

The enemies of liberty and our country should make no mistake, America remains engaged in the world by history and by choice, shaping a balance of power that favors freedom. We will defend our allies and our interests; we will show purpose without arrogance; we will meet aggression and bad faith with resolve and strength; and to all nations, we will speak for the values that gave our nation birth.

America, at its best, is compassionate. In the quiet of American conscience, we know that deep, persistent poverty is unworthy of our nation's promise. Whatever our views of its cause, we can agree that children at risk are not at fault. Abandonment and abuse are not acts of God, they are failures of love. The proliferation of prisons, however necessary, is no substitute for hope and order in our souls. Where there is suffering, there is duty. Americans in need are not strangers, they are citizens, not problems, but priorities, and all of us are diminished when any are hopeless. Government has great responsibilities for public safety and public health, for civil rights and common schools. Yet compassion is the work of a nation, not just a government. Some needs and hurts are so deep they will only respond to a mentor's touch or a pastor's prayer. Church and charity, synagogue and mosque lend our communities their humanity, and they will have an honored place in our plans and in our laws. Many in our country do not know the pain of poverty, but we can listen to those who do. I can pledge our nation to a goal, ""When we see that wounded traveler on the road to Jericho, we will not pass to the other side.""

America, at its best, is a place where personal responsibility is valued and expected. Encouraging responsibility is not a search for scapegoats, it is a call to conscience. Though it requires sacrifice, it brings a deeper fulfillment. We find the fullness of life not only in options, but in commitments. We find that children and community are the commitments that set us free. Our public interest depends on private character, on civic duty and family bonds and basic fairness, on uncounted, unhonored acts of decency which give direction to our freedom. Sometimes in life we are called to do great things. But as a saint of our times has said, every day we are called to do small things with great love. The most important tasks of a democracy are done by everyone. I will live and lead by these principles, ""to advance my convictions with civility, to pursue the public interest with courage, to speak for greater justice and compassion, to call for responsibility and try to live it as well."" In all of these ways, I will bring the values of our history to the care of our times.

What you do is as important as anything government does. I ask you to seek a common good beyond your comfort; to defend needed reforms against easy attacks; to serve your nation, beginning with your neighbor. I ask you to be citizens. Citizens, not spectators; citizens, not subjects; responsible citizens, building communities of service and a nation of character.

Americans are generous and strong and decent, not because we believe in ourselves, but because we hold beliefs beyond ourselves. When this spirit of citizenship is missing, no government program can replace it. When this spirit is present, no wrong can stand against it.

After the Declaration of Independence was signed, Virginia statesman John Page wrote to Thomas Jefferson, ""We know the race is not to the swift nor the battle to the strong. Do you not think an angel rides in the whirlwind and directs this storm?"" Much time has passed since Jefferson arrived for his inauguration. The years and changes accumulate, but the themes of this day he would know, ""our nation's grand story of courage and its simple dream of dignity.""

We are not this story's author, who fills time and eternity with His purpose. Yet His purpose is achieved in our duty, and our duty is fulfilled in service to one another. Never tiring, never yielding, never finishing, we renew that purpose today; to make our country more just and generous; to affirm the dignity of our lives and every life.

This work continues. This story goes on. And an angel still rides in the whirlwind and directs this storm.

God bless you all, and God bless America."
10322,"Han Seung-soo, PGA Closing Speech",http://undocs.org/en/A/56/PV.112,Han Seung-soo,President of the General Assembly,Inauguration Speech,2001,,"The President: We have now come to the end of the fifty-sixth session of the General Assembly, and it is time for me to declare the session closed. As we look back over the past year, I am sure we are all overwhelmed and humbled by a flood of thoughts and emotions. Words such as “extraordinary”, “unusual” or “unprecedented” have been used to characterize our session, so much so that they have become clichés by now. I have been deeply honoured and privileged to serve as President of the General Assembly during this unique and eventful year of great accomplishments for the United Nations. Allow me to share with members some of my thoughts on this occasion. Our session began in a state of crisis triggered by the most atrocious acts of terrorism in history. My term as President was to start on 11 September 2001, a date now etched in everyone’s memory for a very different reason and because of a very different event. Under serious security threats to the United Nations Headquarters building itself, I had urgent consultations with Secretary-General Kofi Annan. We decided to open the General Assembly the next day, on 12 September. Directly after my assumption of the presidency, the General Assembly adopted its first resolution of the session, resolution 56/1, condemning strongly the terrorist attacks and calling for international cooperation to eradicate terrorism. The three months following that day turned out to be one of the most extraordinary and demanding periods in the annals of the General Assembly. We had to reorganize virtually all of our work programme. We devoted one whole week of our debate to measures to combat terrorism, during which the Mayor of New York City was invited to speak for the first time at the United Nations. We also held a two-day meeting on the theme of Dialogue among civilizations to promote inter-cultural understanding, which had particular relevance in the context of our pressing concern with terrorism. Terrorism also topped the agenda of the general debate, which was held in November, two months later than usual, over a period of only seven days but still with the participation of 187 delegations, including 41 heads of State or Government. Joined in the view that international terrorism constitutes a threat to international peace and security as well as a crime against humanity, Member States underscored the key role to be played by the United Nations in intensifying international efforts to eliminate terrorism. Many also cautioned that the fight against terrorism should not be connected with any religion or ethnicity. The heightened awareness of the nature and threat of terrorism has been paralleled by progress in strengthening the legal framework against terrorism, especially through the work of the Sixth Committee. The Assembly has accelerated work with a view to an early conclusion of a comprehensive convention on international terrorism. At the same time, I have urged Member States that have not yet done so to become parties, as a matter of priority, to the existing international conventions relating to terrorism. I hope that the momentum we have created will be built upon during the next session so that the remaining questions can be resolved towards the establishment of a more effective legal framework to root out terrorism. Also high on our agenda has been the question of Afghanistan. The General Assembly has taken coordinated measures with the Security Council to restore peace and security in that war-ravaged nation and to assist in its reconstruction. We welcomed the establishment of the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan and warmly appreciated the efforts of the Secretary-General and his Special Representative to promote peace and security in that country. We have responded promptly and concretely to the need of the Afghan people for massive humanitarian assistance as well as for support in their post-conflict reconstruction efforts. Thus coping with the new challenges, we have also been steadfast in furthering important work already begun. Being the first session of the General Assembly after the historic Millennium Assembly of 2000, our meetings made major advances in the followup to the Millennium Declaration. Noting with appreciation the road map report of the SecretaryGeneral (A/56/326), the Assembly recommended that it be considered a useful guide in the implementation of the Declaration by the United Nations system, and requested the Secretary-General to prepare annual as well as five-year comprehensive reports on progress achieved towards implementing the Declaration. In that regard, I called upon Member States to sustain the political will of the Millennium Summit and to take comprehensive and balanced measures to turn the goals of the Millennium Declaration into reality. The implementation of the Declaration can be effective only through the participation of and cooperation among all actors, including States, the United Nations system, other international and regional organizations and civil society. On the economic front, too, it has been a challenging time for us. With much of the global attention focused on the fight against terrorism, and with the world economy moving perilously close to another recession, we still managed to make progress in a number of important areas. In particular, we have moved forward in our pursuit of development. There have been major events and actions towards the implementation of the millennium development goals. In the process, the Assembly has maintained its focus on, among other things, the eradication of poverty. The momentum generated by the Millennium Summit has been preserved through major United Nations meetings on development held in and outside New York, such as the International Conference on Financing for Development, in March; the meeting of the General Assembly devoted to information and communication technologies for development, in June; and the World Summit on Sustainable Development, held earlier this month. By addressing the critical issues of development financing, the digital divide and sustainable development, respectively, those landmark gatherings have made vital contributions to the international community’s endeavours to achieve economic and social development objectives. In that regard, I have accorded particular priority to the issue of development of Africa. African development — a common element that cuts across the issues of poverty eradication, HIV/AIDS, sustainable development and conflict prevention — has become one of the most daunting challenges of our time. It is in this context that, last April, I visited four West African countries: Ghana, Sierra Leone, the Gambia and Senegal. During those visits, I reaffirmed the strong support of the United Nations system for the efforts of African countries to promote economic and political development, and I exchanged views with their leaders on finding better ways and means to realize our common goals. This year, with the final review of the United Nations New Agenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s under way, we have welcomed the New Partnership for Africa’s Development, on which a highlevel plenary meeting of the General Assembly will be held next week. Learning from the lessons of the New Agenda, we have renewed our commitment to promoting African development in all its aspects. In a related development, the Assembly’s decision last year to create the Office of the High Representative for the Least Developed Countries, Landlocked Developing Countries and Small Island Developing States should be considered a major step forward in advocating the cause of the least developed countries. Our achievements have been no less substantial in the area of human rights and social issues. Postponed in the aftermath of 11 September, the special session on children, held in May this year, proved to be a historic gathering of world leaders to reaffirm their commitment to building a world fit for children. At the opposite end of the age spectrum, the Second World Assembly on Ageing produced a Plan of Action that will guide our efforts to meet the challenges of ageing populations and their far-reaching socio-economic consequences. In these and other endeavours of the United Nations, civil society has become an increasingly important partner. Multi-stakeholder participation has now become established practice in areas as diverse as health and immunization, the rights and well-being of children and the harnessing of information and communication technologies for development. I would like to express my satisfaction at the Assembly’s growing recognition of the instrumental contributions of non-governmental organizations and civil society in general to our work in the economic, social and related fields. Meanwhile, we have taken a great step forward in reforming the United Nations, with a small but significant change. Through a series of informal meetings of the Assembly, we were able to amend the relevant rules of procedure of the General Assembly in order to elect the President and other officials at least three months before the beginning of a new session. This change does not merely represent a procedural modification; it is designed to ensure a more efficient transition and continuity between successive presidencies, and thus facilitate and strengthen the role of the President of the General Assembly. In accordance with the new rules, the former deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Czech Republic, Jan Kavan, was elected as my successor, and the Assembly also elected the 21 vicepresidents and the six Main Committee chairpersons for the fifty-seventh session of the General Assembly. Since then, I have met with President-elect Kavan, as have our two cabinet teams, in many consultations covering all issues relating to our transition. Indeed, this has been the first substantive transition process for the presidency, and it should set a precedent for future sessions of the General Assembly and other bodies in the United Nations system. We have also deliberated the issue of Security Council reform through the Open-ended Working Group on that matter, which met in four sessions from February to July this year. Now in its ninth year, the Working Group has made some progress in the area of the working methods of the Security Council. The more difficult area of membership expansion has not seen much change, except for the addition of a few new proposals. More active debate is expected during the tenth year of the Working Group. On a day-to-day level, I have endeavoured to improve the way in which we conduct the business of the General Assembly. To make our meetings more efficient — especially when they had to be shortened and condensed because of the contingencies of last year — I called for punctuality with time and parsimony with words on the part of everyone. I kept my door open at all times and met with as many people as I could. I also consulted as often as possible with the President of the Security Council and the President of the Economic and Social Council, as well as the chairpersons of regional groups. As we look back on the fifty-sixth session, the magnitude and intensity of our work are reflected in the numbers. We have dealt with 173 agenda items, held 112 plenary meetings and adopted 359 resolutions and 107 decisions. We also held a special session and three rounds of the resumed emergency special session, at which a total of five resolutions and nine decisions were adopted. As President of the General Assembly, I paid official visits to 12 countries. They are, in the order in which I visited them: Ghana, Sierra Leone, the Gambia, Senegal, East Timor — on the occasion of its independence, together with the Secretary-General — Japan, Italy, the Holy See, Austria, the Czech Republic, Australia and Singapore. I would like to take this opportunity to thank the respective Governments once again for their cooperation and hospitality. I also visited the United Nations Offices in Geneva and in Vienna, as well as United Nations peacekeepers in the United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone. In reviewing the past year, however, it would not be fair for me to fail to mention the tasks that remain unfinished and that need to be dealt with on a continuing basis by my successors. These include, among others, measures to eliminate terrorism, prevent conflict, ensure Security Council reform and revitalize the General Assembly. With regard to that last item in particular, I believe that greater consideration should be given to ways to strengthen and institutionalize the role of the President of the General Assembly, in terms not only of the Assembly but also of United Nations meetings held away from Headquarters. We must also heed the views of some Member States that the recent surge of mega-conferences held outside United Nations bodies proper could end up marginalizing the latter and could thus run counter to our goal of strengthening and revitalizing the role of the major United Nations organs. The world today is certainly a very different place from the world that gave birth to the United Nations 57 years ago, in the aftermath of the Second World War. There have been many changes, of which I would like to mention three that directly relate to the future of our world body. First, the field of international relations is becoming increasingly crowded, with more and more actors. The membership of the United Nations has grown from 51 in 1945 to 189 today. The increase is continuing even now, as we will shortly welcome two new Members: Switzerland and East Timor. Furthermore, compared with the initial lot of 51 Members, the current membership of the United Nations comprises a much wider spectrum in terms of political, economic, social and cultural backgrounds. Accordingly the dynamics of the world body has changed dramatically. At the same time, non-State actors, such as international, regional and nongovernmental organizations, have also become important players. Secondly, the world is no longer ideologically divided by the cold war, which had been the dominant feature of international relations during the second half of the twentieth century. In the post-cold-war era, the United Nations has come to play an expanding role in restoring and maintaining peace. Once introduced to fill the gap between the idea of collective security and the reality of unimplemented Charter provisions, United Nations peacekeeping operations have evolved into a highly effective means of furthering peace around the world. At the same time, our world body has been recharged in its work of bringing the community of nations together in the pursuit of universal values and shared standards, brought under the broad rubric of democracy and the market economy. Thirdly, globalization has come to affect every aspect of international life, with far-reaching implications for the work of the United Nations. As States become more interdependent, as problems become more trans-border and global in nature, the issues brought to the United Nations continue to expand and diversify. In the process, we find ourselves dealing with both positive and negative aspects of globalization. While enhancing the well-being of humankind in general, globalization also widens the gap between the haves and the have-nots within and between countries. Bridging the gap and making globalization work to the benefit of all is one important challenge to which the United Nations must rise. The future of the United Nations depends on how the world body adapts and reforms itself to meet the new challenges in this changing world. In the final weeks of our work for the main part of our session last December, we all were delighted and heartened by the awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize jointly to the United Nations and to Secretary-General Kofi Annan. A number of United Nations agencies had received the prize before, but this was the first time that the United Nations as a whole was so honoured. As I stated at that time, the prize should be viewed as both a recognition of past achievements as well as a summons to move forward towards our goals with renewed energy and dedication. It represents the expectations of the peoples of the world for the United Nations to stand equal to the new challenges facing humankind. We should not be complacent either about the achievements of the United Nations or its future role. To be sure, the Organization has its shortcomings. United Nations initiatives have not always been successful, nor have its successes always been permanent. Criticism of the United Nations, both fair and unfair, has been a staple of political debate since 1945. Some of the more constructive criticisms have served as useful bases for exploring ways to improve the work of the Organization. For the longer term, we must ask ourselves how we see the world’s only global organization developing in the coming decades. Will it develop into a kind of world government, or will it remain a forum for nation States? The answers do not come easily, and they will depend on fundamental philosophical questions about the nature of history, human societies and nation States. In any case, being the optimist that I am, I believe that we must begin to explore these questions by placing greater hope in the United Nations. If we seek greater safety and well-being for humanity in general, there must be greater predictability and rule of law in international life. In this rapidly globalizing world, more numerous and diverse actors interact with one another on a constant basis. We should make these interactions more peaceful than violent, more cooperative than confrontational, more productive than wasteful. And at the centre of all of these efforts, we need the United Nations, the only universal body, doing more rather than less. Now I believe that it is time for me to express my deepest appreciation to all who have helped and supported me in discharging my duties. First of all, my sincere gratitude goes to all representatives of Member States for their active participation in the meetings and their guidance in conducting the business of the General Assembly. I wish also to thank the Vice-Presidents, who have kindly taken my place on many occasions, and the Chairpersons, Vice-Chairpersons and Rapporteurs of the Main Committees, who did excellent work despite numerous difficulties under unusual circumstances. I should like also to thank the Vice-Chairpersons of the Open-ended Working Group on Security Council reform and all of those diplomats who worked with me as facilitators on several important issues, including revitalization of the General Assembly and conflict prevention. My heartfelt appreciation goes to SecretaryGeneral Kofi Annan for his invaluable support and guidance. Under-Secretary-General Chen Jian and his dedicated staff of the Department for General Assembly Affairs and Conference Services, whose name will be changed to the Department for General Assembly Affairs and Conference Management, and my own office staff have consistently provided topquality and professional assistance. I thank them. I am immensely grateful to them and to all of the members of the Secretariat, including the security officers and interpreters. Last but not least, I thank the Government and the people of my home country, the Republic of Korea. Whether as Foreign Minister or as a former minister, I have always enjoyed their unwavering support for the success of this presidency. Needless to say, there are many others not mentioned here to whom I am equally indebted. Finally, I should like to offer my best wishes to my successor, President Jan Kavan. I am confident that under his able stewardship, the fifty-seventh session of the General Assembly will achieve very fruitful results."
10323,"Gerhard Schroder, Chancellor Inauguration Speech",https://www.un.org/sg/en/content/sg/press-encounter/2002-02-28/press-conference-german-federal-chancellor-gerhard-schroder,Gerhard Schroder,Chancellor (Germany),Inauguration Speech,2002,,"Press conference with German Federal Chancellor Gerhard Schroder, (unofficial transcript)
Chancellor [As translated from German by the official interpreter.]: Good afternoon, ladies and gentleman. I am, as you might easily imagine, extremely pleased indeed that the Secretary-General, Kofi Annan, has come to Germany once more. We welcome him most warmly. And I was also very, very pleased to see how warmly welcomed his speech was that he delivered this morning in the Bundestag plenary building. All political parties agreed in unison that it was a great speech and it got a lot of support and praise. The co-operation with the United Nations, and obviously the support of the work done by the United Nations, is an essential core of foreign political decision making in Germany.

In view of this background, the Secretary-General and myself have had a very extended conversation about the problems that we are faced with today in the field of international foreign and security policy. In this framework, we both found it very, very important to formulate and then to make sure that it is also implemented - a term and a concept of security today, that this is a more holistic concept than just focusing it on the military implementation thereof. We very much agreed that in fact this was a prime job to be done by the Europeans, that they had to make sure that this more holistic concept of this term ""security"", namely including features of development policy, of the social dimension, and the ecological dimension, were very important, too.

We have then spoken in very concrete terms about the situation on the Balkans, about the situation in Afghanistan, and about the situation in the Middle East.

Obviously those were only some topics amongst many more, but those were the ones we specifically focused on. Now addressing the subject of the Balkans, we were strongly agreed that in fact a success has already been reached by the United Nations Representative, Michael Steiner, who has contributed to the fact that there will now be a government in Kosovo which will contribute tremendously to the stability of that region.

The Secretary-General has also gone in and strongly welcomed the stabilizing role that Germany has taken on and does take on in the Balkans today, and as you all know, we have been called upon by the [former Yugoslav Republic of] Macedonian Government and the President of [the former Yugoslav Republic of] Macedonia, and we have obviously agreed this action with other European partners, that we shall be extending the role of lead nation in [the former Yugoslav Republic of] Macedonia.

As to Afghanistan, the role that Germany has taken in that part of the world, and particularly the role that German soldiers have taken in that part of the world, has been warmly appreciated; and we have also gone in and we have said that we are not thinking about restricting our presence, not thinking about reducing our presence, in this part of the world. We have forces there, that we would possibly be ready to talk about an extension, in terms of time, for our deployment of our soldiers to Afghanistan. Now it is obvious, and I would like to therefore emphasize this fact, that Germany is clearly unable in military terms to take on the role as lead nation in Afghanistan. This is predominantly due to the fact that we are so strongly represented in the Balkans already. I would also not like to conceal the fact that we feel a certain degree of reservation when it is about geographically expanding the mandate over there.

As to the situation in the Middle East, we very strongly share the marked concern that is about the situation in the region and we very much think it is necessary to try to take any hope and any vehicle to hope to return to the negotiation process if at all possible. And we would also like to emphasize that we both very much appreciate the mission undertaken by Saudi Arabia to that effect.

SG: Thank you very much, Mr. Chancellor. Ladies and Gentlemen, let me once again say how happy I am to be back in Germany and to be able to resume this dialogue with the Chancellor on the important issues of the day.

I think the Chancellor has given you a comprehensive idea of what our discussions were about this afternoon, but I would want to add, in the Balkans, and make an appeal to the people of Kosovo that with this Agreement which Steiner was able to negotiate with them, this Agreement that they have accepted, they will be able to form a government for the first time since the elections in November. It is absolutely important that they stick to the Agreement to form the Government and get about the business of governing and focus on the affairs of the people. If they can put their differences behind them, and put the interest of the people and the territory first, they should find ways and means of compromising and getting the job done.

So I appeal to the leaders of Kosovo to show wisdom and leadership at this critical stage and also applaud the success of Steiner and the UN team on the ground.

On the Middle East, if I may say a word, is an issue that has pre-occupied all of us extensively, and recently there are many interesting ideas, particularly the proposal from Saudi Arabia, which comes at an important time and from a quarter that one had not expected to make that proposal at this time. I think it is extremely important that we consider it very seriously as we search for ways and means to break the current tragic impasse in the region.

I think this is a real challenge for the international community to work together to find a way out and I should say that I really appreciate all the work the quartet has been trying to do for a while, the quartet meaning the European Union, the United States, the Russian Federation and the UN, pooling our efforts on this crisis in the Middle East.

And let me conclude my remarks by thanking you, Mr. Chancellor, for your leadership and the support you, and the German people, have given to the UN and the international efforts, not only in the Balkans, but what you are doing now in Afghanistan - the lead role you have taken on in preparing the Afghan National Police and the work you do in developmental and humanitarian aspects of our work. And I do thank you and the people for this important contribution.

Q: Mr. Annan, if I may ask, as someone who has negotiated with Saddam Hussein, how do you assess the likelihood that he will allow the resumption of inspections and that that inspection process will continue and be effective in defusing the current tension with the United States?

SG: As you know, I have agreed to receive an Iraqi delegation in New York on the 7th of March to discuss implementation of Security Council resolutions, including the return of the inspectors to Iraq.

Our last encounter was over a year ago, about a year; it was February last year. Any they will come, I hope, in a constructive and open mood to discuss frankly with me how we get the inspectors back and how they cooperate with the UN.

All their friends, in the region and beyond the region, are telling them to cooperate with the Security Council, and I hope they will. I will know a bit better after I've sat with them. I would only have to hope that they are coming in a constructive spirit.

Q [Translated from German.]: Do you think that the Saudi proposal can be put into effect?

Chancellor: I think the Secretary-General already answered that question, so why don't you just take that for the answer to the question you just put to me.

Q [Translated from German.]: Chancellor, the newspapers are talking about the fact that if Germany were not to take on the role as lead nation, might it possibly be happy to take on what is described as a coordinating role in that region and would you like to see yourself wearing that hat, Chancellor? And then a question to the Secretary-General, you see the present degree of commitment that Germany has shown to Afghanistan, would you expect more of Germany when it comes to Afghanistan?

Chancellor: Now obviously, one can always read lots of things in newspapers, which goes without saying, because newspapers need to be filled, day in, day out, which obviously is a complicated job. But let me say we are wearing a full suit when it comes to this and we do feel satisfied.

SG: On the second part of your question, I have had discussions in Parliament and with the Chancellor and I personally believe that Germany is doing quite a lot for Afghanistan and I applaud their efforts. There has to be burden-sharing and we are encouraging other governments also to step up.

Q [Translated from German.]: My name is Neuhaus and my question is addressed to His Excellency the Secretary-General. Firstly Secretary-General, how is the financial situation of the United Nations at this point in time, and do you expect a stronger contribution from Germany?

SG: Let me first say that the financial situation of the United Nations is not relaxed as a newspaper reported yesterday.

Chancellor: The same as Germany!

(Laughter)

SG: It's improved, but we still need resources. It's improved in the sense that member states, including the United States last year, paid a substantial amount of their arrears and are paying their regular contribution to the UN Budget, but we are facing financial restrictions in the area of economic and humanitarian assistance. The development and the humanitarian assistance budgets are being squeezed because governments are pleading that given the current economic financial and economic environment, their own budgets are having to be cut and therefore they will have to reduce their assistance.

And I have pleaded with governments that given what is happening in the world and our own fight today against terrorism and our discussions about human security, we need to stay committed to the issue of economic development for the long term. Even if one has a temporary difficulty at the moment, we should make a longer term commitment to help the poorer countries do better and to commit ourselves to removing the inequalities between nations and within nations.

And we're going to have a chance to discuss this issue at the Conference on Financing for Development in Monterey and I hope governments will come prepared to make a difference, they will come prepared to get out a message that we are not going to continue doing business as usual and that the world has changed and we are all looking at security in a much broader sense and are prepared not only to engage the political will, but also to make the resources available to get the job done. Thank you very much. *****"
10328,"Jan Kavan, PGA Inauguration Speech",http://undocs.org/en/A/57/PV.1,Jan Kavan,President of the General Assembly,Inauguration Speech,2002,,"The President: It is a great honour and privilege for me to assume the presidency of the fifty-seventh session of the General Assembly today. Let me thank you, members of the Assembly for the trust and confidence you have extended to my country and myself. I would like to assure you that I will do my best to perform all my functions and tasks effectively and with full understanding of the concerns of each Member State, as well as of the interests of the United Nations membership as a whole. At the outset, let me express sincere gratitude to my esteemed predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Han Seung-soo, President of the fifty-sixth session of the General Assembly. Under his able leadership, you have all made the previous session successful in many areas. I personally highly value the fact that under his guidance an entirely new procedure of transition between General Assembly presidencies was established. The newly adopted rules for the election of the President and the General Committee several months ahead constitute an important achievement that will enable all future General Assembly Presidents to assume their responsibilities in a smoother, better organized and more efficient way. The Czech Republic has always emphasized the indispensable role the Organization plays in maintaining international peace and security, enhancing economic, development and humanitarian cooperation, and promoting respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. Over the years, we have served the Organization in many ways, working in various governing bodies in intergovernmental processes and participating in development cooperation and in peacekeeping operations all over the world. I therefore assume the General Assembly presidency with a great sense of responsibility and commitment to contribute, in my own modest personal capacity, to further strengthening the role of the United Nations. Allow me to share our priorities for the work of the fifty-seventh session. As we commemorate the tragic events of 11 September 2001, we must remain focused on the fight against international terrorism and uphold our international coalition. The strengthening of United Nations instruments, including the set of international treaties to combat terrorism, should be central to the efforts of the international community. In this respect, I highly commend the work of the Counter-Terrorism Committee, which has greatly contributed to the implementation of the historic Security Council resolution 1373 (2001). For the part of the General Assembly, we still have an important task to resolve. We lack a general convention against terrorism — including a definition of international terrorism — and I strongly urge Member States to proceed with their work in the ad hoc Working Group of the Sixth Committee on that issue. I am ready to take an active part in all United Nations efforts to combat international terrorism. It is also crucial to continue our work in the area of conflict prevention. Recent experience suggests that certain conflicts can be prevented through preventive diplomacy, preventive deployment and preventive disarmament. The far-reaching recommendations of the Secretary-General’s report on the prevention of armed conflict (A/55/985) serve as a guide to enhance the preventive capacity of the United Nations and to move from a culture of reaction to a culture of prevention. Successful preventive strategies should include accountability and good governance, respect for human rights, promotion of social and economic development, and programmes aimed at attaining disarmament, education and gender equality. The need for an effective strategy for conflict prevention is underlined by the number of existing conflicts troubling today’s world. One of the most protracted of those conflicts is the Middle East conflict. International efforts to bring peace to the area, on both a bilateral and an international basis, have intensified in the past decade. Since its establishment, the United Nations has been actively involved in numerous efforts to resolve the conflict, most recently as one of the players in the “quartet” initiative. There is a growing hope that the “quartet” has the necessary potential to slow down the vicious spiral of violence and to bring new prospects for a peaceful settlement to the parties in the conflict. During our deliberations at the General Assembly, I would like to contribute, to the extent possible, to the existing efforts to find a political resolution to this conflict. Other issues of great importance that I plan to follow closely include poverty eradication, the fight against the HIV/AIDS pandemic and the role of sustainable development in the accelerating process of globalization. The Millennium Summit was a remarkable milestone in our endeavour to explore ways to achieve a more equal distribution of the benefits of globalization. We believe that the fifty-seventh session of the General Assembly is the session in which the implementation of the Millennium Declaration, the Monterrey Consensus and the outcome of the World Summit on Sustainable Development should be duly addressed. The Millennium Declaration laid out the set of development goals that have been widely accepted as targets for development cooperation. In Monterrey, substantial progress was achieved in the area of financing for development, bringing a number of recommendations to national Governments, local authorities and international institutions. The Monterrey Consensus itself gave us guidance on how to change our work in the United Nations in order to achieve better coherence and efficiency. We will also have to improve cooperation among the General Assembly, the Economic and Social Council and the Assembly’s Main Committees. The fifty-seventh session of the General Assembly will face the very important and challenging task of preparing for the high-level dialogue in 2003 as a follow up to the Monterrey Consensus. Building global partnerships for development is a key to its success. During my time in office I will pay special attention to closer cooperation between the United Nations and major stakeholders, namely the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the World Trade Organization, as well as other multilateral institutions, representatives of the private sector, and of course, civil society. At the World Summit on Sustainable Development, held in Johannesburg, Governments reaffirmed their commitment to the achievement of sustainable development. After lengthy and uneasy negotiations, Governments endorsed a plan of implementation that contains at least some specific targets, timetables and ways to alleviate poverty and protect the environment. In addition, more than 220 partnerships representing $235 million in resources, were introduced at the Summit in Johannesburg to complement Government commitments. I am aware that the World Summit did not meet all the expectations of all the people, but I am confident that the compromise reached will enable the United Nations to come up with mechanisms that would be instrumental in timely implementation of the commitments made in Johannesburg. As President of the General Assembly, I will support an early follow-up to the World Summit on Sustainable Development. My attention will be focused also on regional initiatives, such as the New Partnership for Africa’s Development. Although I am aware that there is no direct causal link between poverty and terrorism, at the same time I am convinced that extreme poverty is one of the important ingredients which, combined with others such as unresolved long-term political conflicts, could potentially produce an explosive cocktail. At the very least, this can lead to a feeling of powerlessness, frustration and anger, which can create fertile soil for fundamentalist, radical or even terrorist behaviour. I believe, therefore, that we have to implement the millennium development goals and fight poverty, not only for moral and humanitarian reasons, but also as an integral part of the fight against terrorism and extreme intolerance of all kinds — as part of our struggle for a stable, secure and more just world. I am convinced that, for anyone who truly understands the meaning of international solidarity — and let me stress that I have in mind ordinary human solidarity — the fight against poverty and for human dignity is a task which has to be tackled. There is no option of doing nothing or even doing less than our utmost. Over the past two months I have had the opportunity to consult with some members on questions of United Nations reform. I have heard a clear message: we should make the work of the General Assembly more dynamic, lively and efficient. I plan to build on the achievements of my predecessors, Mr. Harri Holkeri and Mr. Han Seung-soo, and continue the work on the revitalization of the General Assembly. I intend to hold panel discussions on issues of common interest and informal consultations on items that require more information and interactive dialogue. In that regard, I rely on the active involvement of all members. I want to further improve the working methods of the General Assembly by streamlining its agenda. In this regard we have already achieved some modest progress. For the first time ever, in a close and effective cooperation with the Secretariat, a draft programme of work for the entire main part of the fifty-seventh session was provided to Member States several weeks before the beginning of the session. In this programme, agenda items have been entrusted, allowing for joint or consequent debate on interlinked issues. The support of Member States for this proposal could help eliminate repetitive speeches and create better preconditions for more complex consideration of interrelated and cross-cutting issues. In that connection, I would like to inform the Assembly of my strong intention to fully utilize the time allocated for our meetings, including by starting our work punctually. In chairing the meetings I am determined to adhere to the agreed time limits of speeches, and also in this respect, I hope to gain the support and full cooperation of members. I look forward to the outcome of the ongoing work of the Secretariat on the enhancement of its effectiveness, as part of the implementation of the road map. I am convinced that this initiative, combined with the efforts on the revitalization of the General Assembly, could result in more profound changes that would make the United Nations truly efficient. As the Chairman of the Open-ended Working Group on Security Council reform, I will do my utmost to facilitate discussion to bring Member States closer to an agreement. I would like to reiterate that a more representative Security Council reflecting the changed realities of today’s world should be in the interest of Member States. I would like to commend the Secretariat for the assistance provided so far to my office and me. Let me also express my hope that this kind of constructive cooperation will continue throughout the entire fiftyseventh session of the General Assembly. Allow me a very brief concluding reflection. We all come from different parts of the world, bringing with us diverse backgrounds, skills, knowledge and approaches. The diversity of our views and cultures makes our discussions rich and powerful, sometimes even dramatic. On the other hand, we all have a lot in common, particularly our desire to live in a peaceful and secure world where the values and principles expressed in the United Nations Charter are fully honoured. I would like to plead with all members to work during the upcoming session in a spirit of partnership and solidarity. Let open discussion, mutual understanding and tolerance as well as constructive cooperation govern our deliberations. I wish all of us a fruitful and productive session."
10333,"Julian Hunte, PGA Inauguration Speech",http://undocs.org/en/A/58/PV.1,Julian Hunte,President of the General Assembly,Inauguration Speech,2003,,"The President: The leadership of the General Assembly — the United Nations’ sole universal organ — at its fifty-eighth session is, for me, a solemn commitment. I am deeply honoured by the privilege that the membership of the Assembly has accorded me, to serve in this high office at this time of serious challenge for the Organization and for the world. This is also a significant occasion for the Government and the people of Saint Lucia. The United Nations has always been a bedrock of our foreign relations, and we have demonstrated our commitment to the Organization through our sustained support for, and participation in, its work. I wish to pay special tribute to the Prime Minister of Saint Lucia, The Honourable Kenny D. Anthony, whose personal commitment to the United Nations and multilateralism underpins this presidency. My commendation goes to my predecessor, His Excellency Jan Kavan, for the leadership he provided to the General Assembly in what have been critical times for the United Nations. I wish especially to thank him for his cooperation and support, and for the important contribution he made towards implementing the letter and spirit of the General Assembly’s decision to hold early elections for the presidency so as to allow for a smooth transition from the outgoing to the incoming President. I want to assure Mr. Kavan that we will be building on the accomplishments of the General Assembly under his leadership. It has been said that no one leaves footprints in the sands of time by lying down. The footprints of our Secretary-General, Kofi Annan, are indelibly etched in the sands of time because of his continuing achievements and the pace at which he works on behalf of our United Nations. I commend him for his dedication and commitment, and I look forward to working closely with him to realize the goals and objectives of the General Assembly. I would like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to Sergio Vieira de Mello, Special Representative of the Secretary-General, other United Nations staff and all who lost their lives or were injured in the terrible tragedy in Baghdad. It is important that we support United Nations action to protect its staff from terrorist attacks. I believe that the United Nations should remain focused on its objectives in Iraq: to facilitate the restoration of peace and security and to ensure the delivery of humanitarian assistance and the restoration of sovereignty to the people of Iraq. This would be the most fitting tribute to the sacrifice and hard work of Mr. Vieira de Mello and his colleagues. In these turbulent times, the world’s people are looking to the United Nations to safeguard what is fundamental to them, from sustainable development to peace and security. The Organization is challenged to live up to these legitimate expectations, which can be met only by holding firmly to the principles and purposes of the Charter, particularly its vision of cooperation among Member States in solving international problems. Today, the United Nations finds itself at a critical juncture, challenged by an extraordinary set of circumstances and the magnitude of new and existing problems. What, then, should the United Nations do? We must actively pursue the benefits of multilateralism. We must reaffirm the central role of the United Nations, which is the most important multilateral organization ever established and which has stood the test of time. We must uphold the principles and purposes of the United Nations Charter and international law. We must reassert the authority of the General Assembly as the sole universal organ charged under the Charter with important supervisory and policy-making responsibilities. An examination of past sessions of the General Assembly confirms the commitment made by successive Presidents to the reform of the United Nations, in particular to revitalizing and strengthening the Assembly. The imperative of reforming the United Nations has not changed. Indeed, in the current international environment, it assumes greater urgency. There is a view that our 58-year-old Organization requires not just reform but radical transformation. The Secretary-General himself has indicated in recent days that the time may have come for a radical restructuring of the Organization, including a realignment of the principal organs of the Charter. He has further indicated that he plans to make proposals in that regard. I am sure that I speak for all Member States when I say that we look forward with keen interest to any proposals, whether of a procedural or substantive nature, that the Secretary-General may wish to submit for the consideration of the Assembly. Following such a review, the Assembly will be in a position to determine how to proceed, bearing prominently in mind the views which will be presented on United Nations reform by the many heads of State and Government who will be addressing the Assembly in the course of the general debate. As Chair of the working group on the revitalization of the General Assembly, I propose to assess the Group’s work so that we may determine the essential next steps. As President, I am open to other proposals for the revitalization and strengthening of the Assembly. I believe that, as the saying goes, to understand the future we must look to the past. However, while we should learn from our past experiences; we should not be held back by them. In revitalizing the General Assembly, we must therefore balance continuity with change, determining what to hold on to and what to let go of. We should systematically mark each step that meets with success so that we can hold fast to what we have achieved even as we make the strategic choices for future achievements. For example, I have consulted the General Committee about implementation of its mandate and enhancing its role and functioning so as to better assist the President in the management of the Assembly. I believe initiatives such as that hold great promise for our revitalization efforts. Indeed, we are most effective when our goals are achievable. Then, we can act quickly and decisively with cooperation across all regional and other groups and secure commitments from individual Member States to deal with the issues at hand. During months of wide-ranging consultations, I have been inspired by the assurances I received of renewed interest in the General Assembly and by the generally held view that the global problems and crises challenging the United Nations and the world have opened a window of opportunity for the Assembly to broaden its impact on global affairs. We must therefore move boldly to respond to the critics of the Assembly — not in our words, but in our deeds. Member States must demonstrate the power of multilateralism and the value of the Assembly by ensuring that debate goes hand in hand with action, that solutions fit the problems, and that our Assembly has a prominent role in global initiatives for a better world. I am cautiously optimistic that the Assembly is ready to seize the opportunity and move forward. Let us begin by placing the General Assembly at the centre of the unfolding global socio-economic transformation. Globalization and trade liberalization, in particular, are leading the way, changing both the structures and processes of the world economy through a rules-based system. But those twin processes will have failed if they result only in enriching the few at the expense of the many or in creating and accentuating inequity and injustice in the global economy. Further, globalization and trade liberalization are moving at such a rapid pace that most developing countries often have no time to act — only to react. Coming to terms with the rules of the system is posing a serious challenge to many developing countries, even as they endeavour to confront other serious economic problems, including mounting debt, volatile commodity prices, increasing poverty and the HIV/AIDS pandemic. In recent years, many developing countries have seen a sharp reversal in the economic and social gains they had made. Also, the global system has yet to recognize the need for special and differential treatment and, far less, to make the necessary provisions for that important purpose. Since participation in the world economy is key to national economic growth and prosperity for all countries, these matters are becoming even more urgent. The General Assembly has an important role to play in ensuring that globalization and trade liberalization are compatible with achieving equity in the global economy and that the aspirations of all countries for sustainable development, prosperity and peace are met. The Assembly has been the guiding light behind a decade or more of summits and conferences, the objectives of which were to assist Member States, particularly those in the developing world, to meet their development goals. The international community must deliver on the promises made in those forums, more especially in working towards the attainment of the Millennium Development Goals. It has been argued that leadership on global development issues rests with development agencies and international financial institutions, and not with the United Nations. It is a fact, however, that the General Assembly is mandated by the Charter to give policy guidance on development issues. It is the only universal forum in which all Member States may participate equally in the process. Therefore, it is the General Assembly that must ensure coherence in the system. During the fifty-seventh session, the Assembly started to construct the essential bridge between decision-making and implementation in its initiatives on integrated and coordinated implementation and follow-up to the outcomes of major United Nations conferences and summits in the economic and social fields. During this session, we must advance this work and take action on other pressing development issues, such as commodities trading and corporate accountability. We will pursue many of these issues through interactive dialogue. Many developing countries do not have a wide range of development choices available to them and in fact face serious challenges due to their special circumstances. In Mauritius in 2004, small island developing States will again provide leadership on these issues and bring to the fore the broad range of challenges confronting them. They will yet again call for action to address their growing vulnerabilities and the particularly difficult decisions they are forced to make in the current global environment. We urge the international community to support the successful outcome of the 10-year review of the Programme of Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States, as well as the implementation of suggested measures arising from the review. African leaders have themselves taken the initiative for accelerated economic growth, sustainable development, poverty reduction and the improvement of the living standards of the peoples of Africa in the New Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD). The General Assembly has expressed its strong support for NEPAD. It must now encourage the United Nations system and the wider international community to contribute in a meaningful way to the implementation of the goals and objectives of NEPAD. The forthcoming high-level plenary meeting on HIV/AIDS will be of critical importance, especially for Africa and for the Caribbean, because of the debilitating effect that this deadly pandemic has had in these regions. Indeed, HIV/AIDS is one of the most significant challenges to development in the countries affected. We hope that the HIV/AIDS high-level plenary meetings and the High-Level Dialogue on Financing for Development, both so critical to socioeconomic development, can be driving forces for action-oriented solutions in these areas. We believe that the Assembly must also address conflict and development, aware as we are that internal conflicts not only impact peace and security, but can also significantly retard socio-economic development. One of the United Nations outstanding successes is its contribution to the self-determination of a majority of people worldwide whose countries now sit, sovereign and equal, in this General Assembly. The United Nations must remain critically engaged in the decolonization process through the Committee of 24 to ensure that the remaining non-self-governing territories, many of which are in the Caribbean, are able to exercise their right to self-determination. The United Nations has overall responsibility for keeping the peace and making the world a more secure place, with special responsibility given to the Security Council. Undoubtedly, the peaceful settlement of disputes is still an ideal for which the United Nations must strive, even as internal and inter-State conflicts remain pervasive, especially in Africa, Asia and the Middle East. Indeed, events in the Middle East continue to be of grave concern to us all. I recall that in my consultations following my 6 June election, there was some expectation as to what might be accomplished by the proposed road map. The situation, however, continues to deteriorate and calls for renewed commitment on all sides and for new ideas and approaches for peace in the region. The destruction of the United Nations headquarters in Baghdad on 19 August demonstrates that the danger is not only to those embroiled in conflict, but also to those who work in the service of the people of the world. Indeed, targeted United Nations involvement can help to break the vicious cycle of internal turbulence and violent upheavals, which lead to economic decline and stagnation and further exacerbate the conflict. The United Nations is a reservoir of experience and expertise for rebuilding countries in the aftermath of conflict and war. In this volatile global environment, we need to provide the Organization with the means to fulfil its mandate to maintain peace and security and to tackle the underlying causes of conflict and war. In doing so, the United Nations must be sensitive to the right of the people of affected countries to find their own solutions. Acting in any other way could well erode the credibility of the Organization. The General Assembly will have the opportunity to review these important matters when the report of the Security Council comes before it. As required, I will summarize discussion of the report to inform the future deliberations of the Security Council. I expect that both the report and the summary will reflect the crises and challenges the United Nations faces in the areas of peace and security. On the issue of Security Council reform, we cannot retreat from taking a decision on this matter. For more than a decade, we have deliberated on this issue and have made very little progress. I expect that the pronouncements made on this issue in the general debate of the fifty-eighth session will determine whether the political will exists to move reform forward. International standard-setting is an area in which the United Nations has excelled. Today, multilateral treaties set standards for the promotion and protection of human rights, including the rights of women and children, and govern important areas of international relations, such as transnational crime, the seas, disarmament and the rising challenge of terrorism. As we reflect on the second anniversary of the 11 September terrorist attacks and other attacks around the world, we are reminded that we all live in the terrible shadow of terrorism. Not only is terrorism an issue affecting the peace — it also negatively impacts social cohesion and the quality of life, disrupts critical economic activity and destroys infrastructure in the States and regions affected. I believe that the international community should take a two-pronged approach to terrorism. We must confront terrorism wherever it occurs and in whatever form it takes, and we must address the root causes of terrorism as a long-term solution to halting horrific action by the desperate, misguided and disenfranchised. Even as we fight the scourge of terrorism, however, we must do so with the utmost respect for human rights, fundamental freedoms and international law. The United Nations cannot be expected to carry out its mandates without adequate resources. In this budget year, we should commit sufficient resources to enable the Organization to respond effectively to the present demands of the global community within acceptable parameters of responsible budget management. Approximately 100 heads of State and Government have decided to participate in the general debate of the fifty-eighth session of the General Assembly. I will be listening carefully to their priorities, which will provide the framework for the work of this session of the Assembly. I have often been asked in my consultations what I would wish to be the hallmark of the Saint Lucian presidency. My thinking is clear on that matter. I want this session to be an action-oriented one in which decisions are implemented, and in which we work together for that purpose. The people of the world are looking to us to give them hope, seeing that we are working to implement solutions to their problems. The world cannot afford talks that collapse into stalemates, as unfortunately happened in Cancun. The resulting delays in tackling problems that require urgent solutions allow those problems to fester, causing needless suffering and deterioration into irretrievable situations. I have high hopes, however, that the General Assembly is ready to break new ground and to record significant accomplishments during the fifty-eighth session. To do so requires us to choose principle over expediency, precision over ambiguity, objectivity over bias and creative thinking over inflexibility. Above all, we need action over inaction. We must ensure that the policies we pursue during this session of the General Assembly serve not only our national and regional interests, but also the interest of all the world's people. My appeal to the Assembly is that we work together to ensure that this session is remembered as one in which the General Assembly moved forward firmly to re-establish itself as the premier policysetting body of the United Nations."
10335,"Jean Ping, PGA Inauguration Speech",http://undocs.org/en/A/59/PV.1,Jean Ping,President of the General Assembly,Inauguration Speech,2004,,"The President (spoke in French): Allow me at the outset to express a few words regarding the victims of the hurricanes that have recently hit with full force the southern part of the United States, Jamaica, Grenada and Cuba and on this occasion to express all our compassion and solidarity to the Governments and populations of those countries during this terribly difficult time they are facing. It is for me a singular honour and a true privilege, to assume, as of today, the presidency of the United Nations General Assembly at its fifty-ninth session. The solemn opening of this session provides me with an opportunity to again express my deep gratitude, both for the tribute that has been paid to Africa and for the confidence that has been placed in my country, Gabon, its people and the initiatives of its President, His Excellency El Hadj Omar Bongo Ondimba. Let me also convey my sincere congratulations to my predecessor, His Excellency The Hon. Mr. Julian Hunte, for the work he accomplished, in particular in the field of the revitalization of our work. I am also grateful for the great willingness and support that he and his cabinet showed throughout the transitional period. I pay tribute to the Secretary-General for his efforts towards a more peaceful and more just world, and also for the resolve and vision that have been characteristic of his entire mandate at the head of the Secretariat of our Organization. In that tribute I associate all of the United Nations personnel, who work with such courage and dedication, often in extremely perilous conditions, at times paying the highest price for the cause of peace. For my part, I wish to assure all representatives of Member States that I am entirely at their disposal to work with them in achieving the tasks they have entrusted to me and am determined to heed the concerns of their countries. The present session is opening in an international context that is constantly and rapidly changing, marked by multiple threats and numerous challenges. In that situation, the peoples of the world more than ever turn their gaze towards the United Nations — the sole universal forum where the concerns and aspirations of all mankind are expressed in all their diversity. The General Assembly must fully carry out the role assigned to it by the United Nations Charter, by mobilizing, to the greatest extent possible, all of its strengths. For my part, I intend to gear my endeavours to that end, in close cooperation with Members States and the other principal organs of the United Nations. The many areas of conflict and humanitarian crises, the proliferation of weapons, the resurgence of terrorist acts, the spread of poverty and other scourges such as the HIV/AIDS pandemic, the deterioration of the environment, the resurgence of transnational crime, illicit trafficking in narcotics, human rights violations and infringements of the rule of law and democracy are so many concerns for which we must urgently find appropriate answers. Another question which we must pursue through consultations is that of human cloning for purposes of reproduction, because of its ethical and scientific implications. The dramatic repercussions of armed conflicts on the peoples of the Middle East, Africa, South America, Asia or Eastern Europe, remind us each day that we must again double our efforts towards the advent of a world free from the ravages of war. The situation in the Middle East, in particular the Israeli-Palestinian question, demands sustained attention from the international community, because of its ramifications and its impact upon international peace and security. It is undoubtedly in that cradle of age-old civilizations that the future of all of us is, in large part, being played out. The climate prevailing in Iraq and Afghanistan, inter alia, is still a source of great concern. In Africa, wars constitute the dominant source of insecurity, impoverishment and political instability. The Darfur crisis in the Sudan and the recent massacres of refugees on the border between Burundi and the Democratic Republic of the Congo are, alas, such deplorable situations. It is therefore urgent and crucial to reconsider the coordination between intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations acting on the ground, in order to achieve more effective action concerning humanitarian issues. Similarly, there is a clear need to organize the international conference on peace, security and development in the Great Lakes region — an idea which has been accepted in principle. Where peace processes are already underway, it is vital to do everything possible to support them by carrying out concrete measures aimed in particular towards the prevention of conflicts, disarmament, demobilization and the reintegration of former soldiers. Above all, we must ensure that sufficient resources are provided for post-war reconstruction efforts so as to prevent the possible reversion to instability and to avoid the risk of anarchy. Our Organization cannot shirk that responsibility. The proliferation of weapons — especially small arms and light weapons — is contributing to an intensification of conflicts, with increasingly tragic consequences for civilians. Similarly, the ongoing threat to international peace and security represented by the existence of vast quantities of weapons of mass destruction reminds us daily of the imperative need to make progress towards general and complete disarmament. We must all work to that end. We must act quickly so as to find the best means to combat terrorism more effectively. Indeed, the scope and tragic brutality of the events of recent years here in New York and elsewhere in the world demand that we take joint action and remain ever vigilant. Yet, while issues of peace and security daily demand our attention, they should not divert us completely from equally pressing questions, such as development. As Pope Paul VI’s encyclical Populorum Progressio so rightly puts it, “Development, the new name for peace”. We must therefore take action, together, on both fronts simultaneously. In this regard, I would like to stress the important contribution of civil society organizations, which are acting as the true partners of States by expanding their initiatives. If we truly wish to reduce disparities between and within nations and to increase our chances — and those of future generations — of living in a more equitable and secure world, we must abide by the development commitments that we have undertaken, especially those in the Millennium Declaration and the Monterrey Consensus. We have no other choice. Our respective nations and peoples expect a great deal. We cannot turn a deaf ear to that legitimate aspiration for a better world — the legitimate demand for respect for human rights and human security, especially the security of the most vulnerable. Here, I would like to stress the important contribution that women are making to the building of society and to express the hope that their role will be increasingly recognized. We must also vigorously combat trafficking in human beings, in particular in women and children. That is a duty imposed upon us by both law and morality. The most disadvantaged continent — Africa — has taken its destiny into its own hands. Our Organization has decided to accord it priority attention and to support the New Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD) — a substantive programme inspired by the will of political leaders. The New Partnership for Africa’s Development is an expression of the steadfast determination of the peoples of that continent to break with decades of pessimism. Africa has the political support of the international community in that respect. It has also adopted a number of concrete measures, including the Peer Review Mechanism, with a view to promoting peace, good governance, human rights and democracy. But Africa also expects all of its development partners, in particular those of the Group of Eight, to fulfil their commitments entered into within that framework. I should like to draw the attention of the international community to the necessity of better addressing the needs of the least developed countries, the landlocked developing countries and the small island developing countries. We must work in a dedicated fashion to develop appropriate solutions. In that regard, the forthcoming Mauritius conference on the implementation of the Barbados Plan of Action for The Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States will be an important stepping stone. Hunger and malnutrition are also urgent problems whose impact is crucial for disadvantaged populations. The figures speak for themselves; we cannot remain indifferent to them. More than 800 million people throughout the world now suffer from malnutrition, despite the fact that — according to the experts — global food production is adequate. It is therefore vital that the General Assembly focus its efforts on eradicating hunger and poverty in the world. It is essential for the General Assembly, working together with the Economic and Social Council, to mobilize on issues pertaining to international trade negotiations, debt and financing for development, in view of the impact of those issues on the economic and social situation of developing countries. We must strengthen relations among the General Assembly, the Security Council and the Economic and Social Council so as to reinforce the foundations of harmonious international cooperation. Such cooperation is all the more necessary in that it is essential to the achievement of the goals of the Organization. It should also enable us to preserve the role and authority of the General Assembly as the central deliberative body of the United Nations and thexpression of the common will of the 191 States Members of the Organization. To be sure, significant progress has already been achieved in revitalizing our work. We must, however, ensure that the General Assembly preserves all of its prerogatives. It is in our interest — and it is our collective responsibility — to halt the erosion of the authority of this important organ. At the global level, it is clear that the changing circumstances of today’s world call for our Organization to adapt on an ongoing basis so as to enable it better to respond to the requirements of the time. Thus — and this cannot be overemphasized — we must strengthen the role and authority of the United Nations and provide it with all the resources necessary to enable it to fulfil its many missions. Strengthening the role of the United Nations will also depend on our efforts to reform the Security Council. Many proposals have already been made. We must, therefore, show the political will necessary to enable us to move ahead with this important question with a view to achieving a consensus formula. Similarly, we must encourage greater cooperation between United Nations organs and regional and subregional organizations so that those organizations can strengthen their capacity to take more effective action on the ground. The commemoration next year of the sixtieth anniversary of the Organization will provide us with an opportunity to take stock of the progress achieved since the Millennium Declaration and to look with equanimity towards the future. We must, therefore, pool our resources in preparing for that eagerly anticipated event. For my part, I shall ensure that the General Assembly assumes its responsibility in that respect. I invite all the members of the Assembly to work together with a view to adapting the United Nations to the needs of our times and to preparing to better face current and future challenges. I will need all of your support in order to accomplish the delicate task that you have entrusted to me. Finally, I would like again to assure all Member States that I am entirely at their disposal to work together with them and to be ever attentive to their concerns and, of course, to their proposals."
10336,"George W. Bush, Presidential Inauguration Speech",https://avalon.law.yale.edu/21st_century/gbush2.asp,George W. Bush,President (United States),Inauguration Speech,2005,,"Vice President Cheney, Mr. Chief Justice, President Carter, President Bush, President Clinton, members of the United States Congress, reverend clergy, distinguished guests, fellow citizens:

On this day, prescribed by law and marked by ceremony, we celebrate the durable wisdom of our Constitution, and recall the deep commitments that unite our country. I am grateful for the honor of this hour, mindful of the consequential times in which we live, and determined to fulfill the oath that I have sworn and you have witnessed.

At this second gathering, our duties are defined not by the words I use, but by the history we have seen together. For a half a century, America defended our own freedom by standing watch on distant borders. After the shipwreck of communism came years of relative quiet, years of repose, years of sabbatical—and then there came a day of fire.

We have seen our vulnerability—and we have seen its deepest source. For as long as whole regions of the world simmer in resentment and tyranny—prone to ideologies that feed hatred and excuse murder—violence will gather, and multiply in destructive power, and cross the most defended borders, and raise a mortal threat. There is only one force of history that can break the reign of hatred and resentment, and expose the pretensions of tyrants, and reward the hopes of the decent and tolerant, and that is the force of human freedom.

We are led, by events and common sense, to one conclusion: The survival of liberty in our land increasingly depends on the success of liberty in other lands. The best hope for peace in our world is the expansion of freedom in all the world.

America’s vital interests and our deepest beliefs are now one. From the day of our Founding, we have proclaimed that every man and woman on this earth has rights, and dignity, and matchless value, because they bear the image of the Maker of Heaven and earth. Across the generations we have proclaimed the imperative of self-government, because no one is fit to be a master, and no one deserves to be a slave. Advancing these ideals is the mission that created our Nation. It is the honorable achievement of our fathers. Now it is the urgent requirement of our nation’s security, and the calling of our time.

So it is the policy of the United States to seek and support the growth of democratic movements and institutions in every nation and culture, with the ultimate goal of ending tyranny in our world.

This is not primarily the task of arms, though we will defend ourselves and our friends by force of arms when necessary. Freedom, by its nature, must be chosen, and defended by citizens, and sustained by the rule of law and the protection of minorities. And when the soul of a nation finally speaks, the institutions that arise may reflect customs and traditions very different from our own. America will not impose our own style of government on the unwilling. Our goal instead is to help others find their own voice, attain their own freedom, and make their own way.

The great objective of ending tyranny is the concentrated work of generations. The difficulty of the task is no excuse for avoiding it. America’s influence is not unlimited, but fortunately for the oppressed, America’s influence is considerable, and we will use it confidently in freedom’s cause.

My most solemn duty is to protect this nation and its people from further attacks and emerging threats. Some have unwisely chosen to test America’s resolve, and have found it firm.

We will persistently clarify the choice before every ruler and every nation: The moral choice between oppression, which is always wrong, and freedom, which is eternally right. America will not pretend that jailed dissidents prefer their chains, or that women welcome humiliation and servitude, or that any human being aspires to live at the mercy of bullies.

We will encourage reform in other governments by making clear that success in our relations will require the decent treatment of their own people. America’s belief in human dignity will guide our policies, yet rights must be more than the grudging concessions of dictators; they are secured by free dissent and the participation of the governed. In the long run, there is no justice without freedom, and there can be no human rights without human liberty.

Some, I know, have questioned the global appeal of liberty—though this time in history, four decades defined by the swiftest advance of freedom ever seen, is an odd time for doubt. Americans, of all people, should never be surprised by the power of our ideals. Eventually, the call of freedom comes to every mind and every soul. We do not accept the existence of permanent tyranny because we do not accept the possibility of permanent slavery. Liberty will come to those who love it.

Today, America speaks anew to the peoples of the world:

All who live in tyranny and hopelessness can know: the United States will not ignore your oppression, or excuse your oppressors. When you stand for your liberty, we will stand with you.

Democratic reformers facing repression, prison, or exile can know: America sees you for who you are: the future leaders of your free country.

The rulers of outlaw regimes can know that we still believe as Abraham Lincoln did: “Those who deny freedom to others deserve it not for themselves; and, under the rule of a just God, cannot long retain it.”

The leaders of governments with long habits of control need to know: To serve your people you must learn to trust them. Start on this journey of progress and justice, and America will walk at your side.

And all the allies of the United States can know: we honor your friendship, we rely on your counsel, and we depend on your help. Division among free nations is a primary goal of freedom’s enemies. The concerted effort of free nations to promote democracy is a prelude to our enemies’ defeat.

Today, I also speak anew to my fellow citizens:

From all of you, I have asked patience in the hard task of securing America, which you have granted in good measure. Our country has accepted obligations that are difficult to fulfill, and would be dishonorable to abandon. Yet because we have acted in the great liberating tradition of this nation, tens of millions have achieved their freedom. And as hope kindles hope, millions more will find it. By our efforts, we have lit a fire as well—a fire in the minds of men. It warms those who feel its power, it burns those who fight its progress, and one day this untamed fire of freedom will reach the darkest corners of our world.

A few Americans have accepted the hardest duties in this cause—in the quiet work of intelligence and diplomacy … the idealistic work of helping raise up free governments … the dangerous and necessary work of fighting our enemies. Some have shown their devotion to our country in deaths that honored their whole lives—and we will always honor their names and their sacrifice.

All Americans have witnessed this idealism, and some for the first time. I ask our youngest citizens to believe the evidence of your eyes. You have seen duty and allegiance in the determined faces of our soldiers. You have seen that life is fragile, and evil is real, and courage triumphs. Make the choice to serve in a cause larger than your wants, larger than yourself—and in your days you will add not just to the wealth of our country, but to its character.

America has need of idealism and courage, because we have essential work at home—the unfinished work of American freedom. In a world moving toward liberty, we are determined to show the meaning and promise of liberty.

In America’s ideal of freedom, citizens find the dignity and security of economic independence, instead of laboring on the edge of subsistence. This is the broader definition of liberty that motivated the Homestead Act, the Social Security Act, and the G.I. Bill of Rights. And now we will extend this vision by reforming great institutions to serve the needs of our time. To give every American a stake in the promise and future of our country, we will bring the highest standards to our schools, and build an ownership society. We will widen the ownership of homes and businesses, retirement savings and health insurance—preparing our people for the challenges of life in a free society. By making every citizen an agent of his or her own destiny, we will give our fellow Americans greater freedom from want and fear, and make our society more prosperous and just and equal.

In America’s ideal of freedom, the public interest depends on private character—on integrity, and tolerance toward others, and the rule of conscience in our own lives. Self-government relies, in the end, on the governing of the self. That edifice of character is built in families, supported by communities with standards, and sustained in our national life by the truths of Sinai, the Sermon on the Mount, the words of the Koran, and the varied faiths of our people. Americans move forward in every generation by reaffirming all that is good and true that came before—ideals of justice and conduct that are the same yesterday, today, and forever.

In America’s ideal of freedom, the exercise of rights is ennobled by service, and mercy, and a heart for the weak. Liberty for all does not mean independence from one another. Our nation relies on men and women who look after a neighbor and surround the lost with love. Americans, at our best, value the life we see in one another, and must always remember that even the unwanted have worth. And our country must abandon all the habits of racism, because we cannot carry the message of freedom and the baggage of bigotry at the same time.

From the perspective of a single day, including this day of dedication, the issues and questions before our country are many. From the viewpoint of centuries, the questions that come to us are narrowed and few. Did our generation advance the cause of freedom? And did our character bring credit to that cause?

These questions that judge us also unite us, because Americans of every party and background, Americans by choice and by birth, are bound to one another in the cause of freedom. We have known divisions, which must be healed to move forward in great purposes—and I will strive in good faith to heal them. Yet those divisions do not define America. We felt the unity and fellowship of our nation when freedom came under attack, and our response came like a single hand over a single heart. And we can feel that same unity and pride whenever America acts for good, and the victims of disaster are given hope, and the unjust encounter justice, and the captives are set free.

We go forward with complete confidence in the eventual triumph of freedom. Not because history runs on the wheels of inevitability; it is human choices that move events. Not because we consider ourselves a chosen nation; God moves and chooses as He wills. We have confidence because freedom is the permanent hope of mankind, the hunger in dark places, the longing of the soul. When our Founders declared a new order of the ages; when soldiers died in wave upon wave for a union based on liberty; when citizens marched in peaceful outrage under the banner “Freedom Now”—they were acting on an ancient hope that is meant to be fulfilled. History has an ebb and flow of justice, but history also has a visible direction, set by liberty and the Author of Liberty.

When the Declaration of Independence was first read in public and the Liberty Bell was sounded in celebration, a witness said, “It rang as if it meant something.” In our time it means something still. America, in this young century, proclaims liberty throughout all the world, and to all the inhabitants thereof. Renewed in our strength—tested, but not weary—we are ready for the greatest achievements in the history of freedom.

May God bless you, and may He watch over the United States of America."

Chancellor Angela Merkel spoke of a strong and just future Germany

Merkel, 51, who is Germany's first female leader and the first from the former communist east, struck a personal note when she discussed her hopes for the country's future. ""The biggest surprise of my lifetime is freedom,"" she said, saying she had never expected to see the other side of the Berlin Wall before she retired.

""Let us dare to have more freedom,"" she said, including more opportunities for Germans to pursue their hopes for prosperity. ""Who would have thought that the highest governmental office would be given to a woman this year already?"" Merkel said.

Turning to economic issues, Merkel told parliament that her left-right government would return the country to its status as an economic powerhouse. ""We want to create the conditions for Germany to be among the top three in Europe in 10 years"" in terms of economic growth, she said in the keenly awaited address.

Merkel took office last week in a coalition with her conservative Christian Democrats and her predecessor Gerhard Schröder's Social Democrats with a mandate to slash the 11-percent unemployment rate, jumpstart the moribund economy and tame the spiraling public deficit. She wasted no time in painting a picture of a country on the ropes, but one more than capable of fighting back.

Merkel urges Germany to take its foot off the brakes

REGIERUNGSERKLAERUNG MERKEL
Germany may be on the ropes, Merkel says, but it can fight back

""Our growth hasn't picked up in years. Our debt has risen to alarming levels. The new (eastern) states stopped catching up years ago,"" Merkel said. But she said her coalition government had a unique opportunity to solve these problems if it worked together. ""A government of action will have to take some blows. But we will show one thing: We have major potential in our country. Germany is full of opportunities -- inside and outside.""

""One thing is clear: we all bear responsibility for the fact that we are not using our opportunities to the full. Let us release the brakes on growth ... Let us show what is possible,"" she said.

""We want to get the labor market in shape, we want to make our schools and universities world-class, we want to bring the deficit under control and repair our health, pension and nursing systems,"" she said to applause.

Germany to work with EU within limits

REGIERUNGSERKLAERUNG MERKEL
Merkel told parliament that Germany would not carry the EU burden

Merkel also pledged that her government would try to find a compromise with the European Union over its 2007-2013 budget. But she warned that Germany would not accept too great a burden, adding that she would press for a ""lasting solution which is in the pan-European interest"" at the crucial EU summit in December.

""Germany is prepared to contribute to a sensible compromise,"" she said but added that Germany's ""frightening"" debt levels meant the economy would not be able to tolerate new budget obligations. The last EU summit in June ended in stalemate and recriminations over a proposed 1.06 percent budget spending cap.

Merkel also used the address to reiterate her stance on the kidnapping of Susanne Osthoff, the German national taken captive a few days ago in Iraq. The chancellor told the assembly that Germany would not bow to the captors. ""We will not be blackmailed,"" Merkel said. ""We cannot fail in our fight against terrorism.""

Hostage stance reiterated, terrorism condemned

Entführte Deutsche Susanne Osthoff
German archeologist Susanne Osthoff was abducted in Iraq this week

Merkel added that her government ""was aiming all its efforts at protecting the lives of Susanne Osthoff and her driver"" and reiterated that she ""strongly"" condemned the hostage-taking, saying that the government ""will do all it can to bring them to safety as soon as possible.""

The chancellor told parliament that international terrorism was the biggest challenge facing the international community: ""It is directed at everything that is important to us, at the core of our civilization. It is directed against our entire value system; against freedom, tolerance and the respect of human dignity, democracy and the rule of law.""

""One thing is clear: This government, this parliament will not let itself be pressured.""

Merkel speaks of open dialogue with Islam

Türken in Deutschland Frauen mit Kopftuch
Merkel encouraged dialogue but condemned honor killings and forced marriage

During her speech, Merkel also addressed the topic of Islam and pledged an ""open and honest"" dialogue with the Islamic world. ""Dialogue with Islam carries great significance … we have to learn to understand each other,"" she said. ""We will do this in an open and honest way. We will not brush aside differences, but name them clearly.""

While attempting to open the way for communication, Merkel denounced forced marriages and so-called honor killings. ""I say this explicitly, as chancellor and also as a woman, that forced marriages or honor killings -- both, by the way, awful words -- have nothing, completely nothing, to do with honor and also no place at all in our society,"" she said. ""We cannot tolerate them.""

But Merkel stressed that in general ""Germany is a tolerant and cosmopolitan country"" and pledged to defend the rights of all minority groups."
10340,"Jan Eliasson, PGA Inauguration Speech",http://undocs.org/en/A/60/PV.1,Jan Eliasson,President of the General Assembly,Inauguration Speech,2005,,"The President: It is a great honour for me to assume the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixtieth session. I thank all members for the trust they have placed in me. It is no less an honour for me to succeed President Jean Ping, who has carried a heavy burden of responsibility with grace, warmth and humour over the past year. I want to thank him in particular for his tireless efforts over the past few weeks, which have brought us together not only in work, but also in friendship. I also want to pay tribute to the SecretaryGeneral, who has responded with calm and determination to the difficulties facing the Organization while maintaining a longer-term perspective and a sense of vision, as we saw in his report “In larger freedom” (A/59/2005). I thank them both, on behalf of all of us assembled here today. It is almost 60 years since the first session of the General Assembly opened. When I read the words of Mr. Zuleta Angel of Colombia — the opening speaker on that occasion — I was struck by their relevance today. He said “the whole world now waits upon our decisions, and rightly — yet with understandable anxiety — looks to us now to show ourselves capable of mastering our problems” (Official Records of the General Assembly, First part of first session, Plenary Meetings, 1st meeting). That was in 1946. Mr. Zuleta Angel spoke of anxiety in the world outside. Today, we know that, 60 years later, we also have reason to feel anxiety and uncertainty about the future. Members have all worked long and hard, particularly over recent weeks. The process of working on the High-level Meeting outcome document has been intense and all-consuming. The reform programme we have been considering has been the most ambitious and wide-ranging since the formation of the United Nations. Expectations around the world have — again, as in 1946 — been exceptionally high. Our discussions have not always been easy. The issues have been difficult and have, for many members, touched upon important national interests. As a result of that process, we have now received from the General Assembly at its fifty-ninth session a comprehensive draft High-level Meeting outcome document. I welcome it as a strong basis for the process of reform which we will take forward in the sixtieth session. Tomorrow, we begin that process. I expect that, at the High-level Meeting, our leaders will add political momentum and set the waymarks for the road ahead. We will need to listen carefully to them and to the expectations of their people. On Friday, as our leaders are invited to adopt the outcome document, we should take stock of what we have heard. And on Saturday, when we know the mandate our leaders have given us, we should start the urgent task of translating their words into action. I shall revert to that when we open the general debate. I am confident that the debate, which will focus on follow-up and implementation of the High-level Meeting, will provide further concrete ideas and proposals for our work ahead. At the end of the general debate, I intend to reflect further on the situation and present to the Assembly an outline of work for the year ahead. That goes both for the regular work of the General Assembly, including revitalization, and for keeping up the momentum of the reform process. When we go into that work, we should be reminded of two important realities: one, the expectations and dreams of our peoples for this Organization, our United Nations; the other, the sombre realities in this world, which we must also feel in these halls. The people we serve have expected a lot of us. That is, in part, a tribute to civil society and to the many commissions, panels and projects that have done much to build momentum for progress on development, peace and security and human rights. It also reflects the fact that we are clearly not making fast enough progress with regard to many of the commitments we have already made — not least, in the case of development, the Millennium Development Goals. I believe it is also because the peoples of the world can see that a reinvigorated United Nations and a renewed commitment to multilateralism are in all of their interests. And they can see that we have to act now to get it right. Why do they see international cooperation as important? Perhaps because it is now so apparent that the world’s problems — the realities that I spoke of — are so complex and interlinked. As Dag Hammarskjöld once said, the nerve signals from a wound in the world are felt at once through the body of mankind. The tsunami in Asia had a devastating impact on people in the region, but the effects were also felt — in different ways — around the world. The recent disaster on the Gulf coast of the United States has further reminded us that no nation — no nation — is immune from natural disasters and environmental threats. And the terrorist attack on New York four years ago this week, and the number of abhorrent terrorist attacks all over the world in recent years, remind us that no nation — again, no nation — can be immune to threats to its security in today’s world. It is also increasingly clear that we need a renewed multilateralism to tackle the many silent tsunamis of disease and poverty which are killing hundreds of thousands of our fellow human beings. As an antipoverty campaign reminded us this year, a child dies somewhere in the world as a result of preventable — I repeat: preventable — poverty every three seconds. That is unacceptable. Meanwhile, although the number of active conflicts in the world is in decline, there remain too many people whose lives are ravaged by war or who live in countries which are struggling to recover from conflicts. To help those people build peace must be our common cause. The world also needs to deal with the global challenges of disarmament and non-proliferation and to prevent and resolve conflict. We need to get better at detecting the early signs of human rights abuses and coming together to address them. And we need to reflect on why an Organization which was set up to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war — as the beautiful Charter puts it — has been unable to prevent ethnic cleansing, mass killings and even genocide. It is time for us all to stop saying “Never again”. To deal with all these realities, we must reform the way this Organization functions. That will be an ongoing endeavour, but also an urgent one. We owe it to those we serve to ensure that our management, oversight and accountability systems are of the highest possible calibre. I believe that all of these issues give us, the General Assembly, real reasons and impetus to rally together. Tackling global poverty, addressing climate change, fighting terrorism and protecting human rights: these are not issues that only one group or one region has an interest in resolving. They are issues that each and every one of us has a duty to resolve together, in the spirit of the best traditions of the United Nations: transparency, civility and mutual respect. At the same time, we need to strive for efficiency and a sense of purpose. So, in closing, we have all worked exceptionally hard. Some of us will have, for the first time in a long while, a full night’s sleep — unless our leaders keep us busy. The world’s expectations are high. We will go into the High-level Meeting and await our leaders’ direction and vision. Recognizing the responsibility history has placed on us to shape the future for all our peoples, we must all move forward, together, with renewed energy and with renewed determination. Let us not underestimate what we can do. The world’s poorest, the world’s least secure, the world’s most oppressed demand change. Let us show them what we can do."
10347,"Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa, PGA Inauguration Speech",http://undocs.org/en/A/61/pv.1,Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa,President of the General Assembly,Inauguration Speech,2006,,"The President: Before proceeding to the items on our agenda, I have the sad duty to pay tribute to the memory of the late head of State of the Kingdom of Tonga, His Majesty King Taufa’ahaù Tupou IV, who passed away on Sunday, 10 September 2006. On behalf of the General Assembly, I request the representative of Tonga to convey our condolences to the Government and the people of Tonga and to the bereaved family of His Majesty King Taufa’ahaù Tupou IV. May I now invite representatives to stand and observe a minute of silence in tribute to the memory of His Majesty King Taufa’ahaù Tupou IV. The members of the General Assembly observed a minute of silence.
 The President (spoke in Arabic): I should like first of all to refer to yesterday’s commemoration of the 11 September terrorist attacks, which took place five years ago, in 2001. We share the grief of the American people and of the families of the victims. It is an honour and pleasure for me to preside over the General Assembly at its sixty-first session. I would like to take this opportunity to thank you all for the support and confidence you have placed in me. I would like to begin by welcoming the Republic of Montenegro, the newest member of the United Nations family. I believe that it will play a valuable role in furthering the work and ideals of the Organization. Today, the United Nations faces many challenges at all levels and therefore needs the support of the people of the world, just as the people of the world need this Organization, for this is an Organization of hope that is based on commitment, consensus and coexistence. The numerous meetings, discussions and conferences that bring together people from all over the world provide a real platform to exchange experiences and perspectives. This enables us to understand each other better, in order to achieve a global consensus on political, security, economic, environmental and social issues. Only by working together can we translate our commitments into effective actions. The 2005 world summit was a prime example of this vision. It provided the General Assembly with a clear and wide-ranging reform agenda in the fields of development, international peace and security, human rights and management reforms. Its outcome was indeed a pillar of hope. It confirmed once again the strong and renewed commitment of the world’s leaders to the values and principles of the Charter of the United Nations, demonstrating, by their commitment, a solid resolve to implement the Millennium Development Goals. World leaders’ collective vision of a more responsive multilateral approach to the many challenges facing the world will continue to guide our common efforts to build a safer, freer and more prosperous world for all human beings. The General Assembly at its sixtieth session, under the leadership of President Eliasson, implemented many of the recommendations adopted at the summit, such as the creation of the Peacebuilding Commission and the Human Rights Council, the establishment of the Central Emergency Response Fund and the adoption of resolutions on development, management reform and a Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy. Here, I should like to congratulate President Eliasson for his tireless efforts to move the reform agenda forward. I commend all Member States for their cooperation and for the spirit of compromise shown throughout the sixtieth session. They worked under intense pressure, and I trust that we can continue to move ahead with the same momentum during this session. I should also like to pay tribute to the SecretaryGeneral, Kofi Annan, for his tireless efforts in the service of the mission and the ideals of the United Nations during his tenure. He has played a pivotal role in enhancing and strengthening the Organization to meet global challenges and the emerging needs of the world. It is important that we build upon, broaden and deepen the progress achieved thus far. Our achievements demonstrate the ability of the General Assembly to produce concrete results on important matters that concern the international community. They also demonstrate and confirm the continued importance of the Assembly as the chief deliberative, policymaking and representative organ of the United Nations. In order to continue playing that role, the General Assembly must continue to evolve and to strive to deliver sustainable solutions to the major challenges of our time. That can take place only within the framework of multilateralism. A well-functioning and proactive multilateral system is in the interest of all nations, particularly at a time when our growing interdependence is the basis for our peaceful coexistence. Multilateralism is the most effective way to ensure our collective peace and security, protect human rights and uphold the rule of law. I believe that it is the common responsibility of Member States to make the General Assembly and the United Nations as a whole even more effective. As efforts to revitalize the General Assembly are under way, we must not lose sight of the main purpose of those actions: to meet the rising expectations of hundreds of millions of people around the world. We have the challenging task of meeting the expectations of those who are poor, malnourished or illiterate or the victims of disease. We have the challenging task of ensuring their economic and social security, which is just as important as their political and military security. We have the challenging task of liberating them from want while seeking to liberate them from fear. I should also like to stress that more than half of the world’s population — namely, women — typically have less access to health care, employment, decisionmaking and property ownership. That disparity must be addressed so that both women and men can enjoy the same opportunities, the same rights and the same responsibilities in all aspects of life. To promote gender equality, we need to empower women so that they have more autonomy to lead their lives. To achieve those goals, it is essential that we work closely together so that, together, we can promote human rights and achieve sustainable development. We cannot confront all these challenges effectively if we do not have peace and security. The United Nations plays a crucial role in responding to the aftermath of natural disasters and maintaining peace and security in areas affected by violent conflict. Regrettably, the recent violence in the Middle East caused heavy casualties on both sides and extensively damaged the Lebanese infrastructure. Today, manmade conflicts are destroying lives and displacing people on a scale sometimes exceeding that of the destructive effects of nature, including floods and hurricanes. The people of the world have placed an enormous responsibility on our shoulders, as Member States, to identify and address the causes of human conflicts. Only by working together will we be able to defeat the injustices that are at the root of conflicts.  International terrorism is another equally pressing and closely related issue. We must develop and adopt both preventive and defensive measures to combat terrorism. Within that context, I cannot emphasize enough the importance of high-quality education and conscientious media as positive vehicles for nurturing tolerance, compassion and critical thinking. Now that the Assembly has adopted a resolution on a Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy (resolution 60/288), I hope that during this session we can continue our efforts to successfully reach agreement on a comprehensive convention on terrorism. As we prepare ourselves to complete the tasks remaining from the previous session, we shall not overlook those recommendations of the 2005 World Summit Outcome (resolution 60/1) that have yet to be fully implemented, such as disarmament and nonproliferation, Security Council reform, mandate review and system-wide coherence. All of these are crucially important agendas. Working together in the spirit of multilateralism to achieve these goals, we can deliver a programme of work to renew, strengthen and update the United Nations. Reform is a process rather than an event, and we will need to actively pursue work on a variety of pending issues. I trust that Member States will work together to address every issue on its own merits so that progress can be achieved at a steady pace on all the various aspects of the reform agenda. We, the Member States, must identify our priorities. I will be more than happy to listen to members’ views during the general debate and in the months ahead so that, together, we can design an action-oriented and practical workplan. Before that, we will hold the first ever High-level Dialogue on International Migration and Development. I anticipate that the discussions will underscore the challenges of migration and development and the need for a collective initiative. The following week, we will hold a High-level Meeting on the midterm comprehensive global review of the implementation of the Programme of Action for the Least Developed Countries for the Decade 2001- 2010. It will outline the successes achieved and the obstacles faced by the least developed countries and lay down guidelines for the way forward — actions that need to be taken by the least developed countries, their development partners and the international community as a whole to successfully implement the Programme of Action. Here, I should like to commend the important role that non-governmental organizations, civil society and the private sector play in the work of the General Assembly. It is my intention to continue to encourage and value their contributions in addressing the many challenges confronting the international community. Since its inception in 1945, the United Nations has been a global beacon of hope and a global humanitarian necessity. Indeed, world leaders and thinkers had many years before expressed the need for a truly global forum based on high ideals. At the Paris Conference in January 1919, the President of the United States, Woodrow Wilson, called for the creation of an organization that would be the eye of the nations, to keep watch and act on their common interests — an eye that does not slumber, but is everywhere attentive. Today, should that eye become weary, it is up to us, the Member States, to revitalize and reinforce its role so that our Organization remains the beacon of hope for the peace, prosperity and order of all nations. (spoke in English). I give the floor to the representative of the Islamic Republic of Iran."
10348,"Ban Ki-moon, SG Inauguration Speech",http://undocs.org/en/A/61/PV.31,Ban Ki-moon,Secretary General (United Nations),Inauguration Speech,2007,,"Mr. Ban Ki-moon: I stand before the members of the General Assembly, deeply touched and inspired by their generous words of congratulation and encouragement. With boundless gratitude for the confidence placed in me by the Member States, and with an unswerving resolve to honour that trust, I humbly accept the appointment as the eighth SecretaryGeneral of this great Organization, our United Nations. I wish to extend my deepest respect and appreciation to all the leaders and peoples of the Member States for their strong support. Thank you, Madam, for graciously preparing and guiding the meeting today. I greatly look forward to supporting you and working with you as you wisely steer the Assembly towards a very successful session. I follow in a line of remarkable leaders. They, too, faced this moment, each at a critical juncture in the Organization's history. Like me today, they must have pondered what the years ahead would hold at the helm of this dynamic institution. Each made important and lasting contributions to our common enterprise in upholding humanity's deepest values and highest aspirations. In particular, Secretary-General Kofi Annan has astutely guided our Organization into the twenty-first century. He has defined an ambitious agenda that has made the United Nations truly indispensable to peace, prosperity and human dignity around the world. Our debt to his courage and vision is immeasurable. I resolve to build upon his legacy. By completing the appointment of the next Secretary-General with such alacrity, the Members have opened an unprecedented opportunity. Never before has an incoming Secretary-General been given sufficient time to prepare; they have given me more than two months. I will use these weeks to consult widely on how best to proceed with our common agenda of reform and revitalization. I will listen attentively to Member’s concerns, expectations and admonitions. 
I am deeply honoured to become the second Asian to lead the Organization, following Mr. U Thant, who ably served the world four decades ago. It is quite fitting that Members have now turned to Asia again for the next Secretary-General to guide the United Nations system through its seventh decade. Asia is dynamic and diverse, and Asia aspires to take on greater responsibilities for the world. Having come so far and rising still, the region is living and shaping the full range of achievements and challenges of our current times. Asia is also a region where modesty is a virtue, but the modesty is about demeanour, not about vision and goals. It does not mean a lack of commitment or leadership. Rather, it is a quiet determination in action to get things done without so much fanfare. That may be the key to Asia's success and to the United Nations future. Indeed, our Organization is modest in its means, but not in its values. We should be more modest in our words, but not in our performance. The true measure of success for the United Nations is not how much we promise, but how much we deliver for those who need us most. Given the enduring purposes and inspiring principles of our Organization, we need not shout its praises or preach its virtues. We simply need to live them every day, step by step, programme by programme, mandate by mandate. The surge in demand for the United Nations services attests not only to the United Nations abiding relevance, but also to its central place in advancing human dignity. The United Nations is needed now more than ever before. The United Nations core mission in the previous century was to keep countries from fighting each other. In the new century, the defining mandate is to strengthen the inter-State system so that humanity may be better served amidst new challenges. From the Balkans to Africa, from Asia to the Middle East, we have witnessed the weakening or absence of effective governance, leading to the ravaging of human rights and the abandonment of long-standing humanitarian principles. We need competent and responsible States to meet the needs of ""we the peoples"" for whom the United Nations was created; and the world's peoples will not be fully served unless peace, development and human rights — the three pillars of the United Nations — are advanced together with equal vigour. The road that we must pave towards a world of peace, prosperity and dignity for all has many pitfalls. 
As Secretary-General, I will make the most of the authority invested in my Office by the Charter and the mandate the Members give me. I will work diligently to materialize our responsibility to protect the most vulnerable members of humanity and for the peaceful resolution of threats to international security and regional stability. In order to meet those growing mandates and expectations, we have engaged in the most sweeping reform in the history of the Organization. The very scope of the reform has taxed the attention and energies of both the delegations and the Secretariat, but we must stay the course. We need to muster the human, institutional and intellectual resources, and to organize them properly. We should do our part in meeting the Millennium Development Goals, the expanding peace operations, the threats posed by terrorism, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, HIV/AIDS and other pandemics, environmental degradation, and the imperatives of human rights. Let us remember that we reform not to please others, but because we value what this Organization stands for. We must reform because we believe in its future. To revitalize our common endeavour is to renew our faith not only in the United Nations programmes and purposes, but also in each other. We should demand more of ourselves, as well as of our Organization. To cut through the fog of mistrust is going to require more intensive dialogue. We cannot change everything at once, but if we choose wisely and work together transparently, flexibly and honestly, progress in a few areas will lead to progress in many more. Only the Member States can revitalize this Organization, but I will always be there to assist and facilitate as needed. (spoke in French) As Secretary-General, I am resolved to manage my Office openly and responsibly. I will seek to build consensus through a free exchange of ideas and critiques. Only through the candid, open testing of ideas and proposals can we identify better means of serving the peoples of the world. I will work actively in reaching out to all stakeholders. In particular, in order to bring the United Nations closer to the people, I will widely engage civil society in dialogue. I will seek the support and input of humanitarian advocacy groups, businesses and other constituents of the global citizenry for the good of the Organization. My tenure will be marked by ceaseless efforts to build bridges and close divides. Leadership of harmony, not division, and by example, not instruction, has served me well so far. I intend to stay the course as Secretary-General. I will be fully accountable for the management of this institution. Member States set the mandates and provide the resources. If the resources are not sufficient for the task at hand, I will not be shy about saying so, but once we in the Secretariat have taken on a task, we must accept full responsibility for its achievement. (spoke in English) I am eager to join the ranks of the world’s premier Secretariat. I have deep respect and admiration for the able, dedicated and courageous men and women who serve this Organization day in and day out, often in the face of danger and personal sacrifice. To them, I pledge my utmost support, dedication and solidarity. Maintaining their proud heritage, while vigorously holding them to the highest standards of professionalism and integrity, will be a prime goal of my tenure. The aim of Secretariat reform is not to penalize but to reward, so that their talent and skill, experience and dedication may be fully mobilized and properly utilized. It will reward hard work and excellence to boost morale, making everyone accountable for his or her own action or inaction, and pushing for greater gender balance, in particular at senior levels. That will be my guide as I rally the Secretariat staff for our very best performance in serving the Organization. As Secretary-General, I am far from perfect, and I will need the unsparing support, cooperation and trust of all represented here, but I pledge to serve them well, with all of my heart and to the best of my abilities. I will seek excellence with humility. I will lead by example. Promises should be made for the keeping. That has been my motto in life. I intend to stick to it as I work with all stakeholders for a United Nations that delivers on its promises. My heart is overflowing with gratitude towards my country and people who have sent me here to serve. It has been a long journey from my youth in war-torn and destitute Korea to this rostrum and these awesome responsibilities. I was able to make the journey because the United Nations was with my people in our darkest days. It gave us hope and sustenance, security and dignity. It showed us a better way. So I feel at home today, however many miles and years I have travelled. For the Korean people, the United Nations flag was and remains a beacon of better days to come. There are countless stories of that faith. One belongs to me. In 1956, when the cold war was raging around the world, as a young boy of just 12 I was chosen to read out a public message on behalf of my elementary school, addressed to the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr. Dag Hammarskjöld. We urged him to help the people of a certain faraway European country in their fight for freedom and democracy. I hardly understood the deeper meaning of the message, but I knew that the United Nations was there for help in times of need. Fifty years later, the world is a much more complex place, and there are many more actors to turn to. During these years, I have travelled many times around the world. I have been elated by the successes of the United Nations in making life better for countless people. I have also been pained by scenes of its failures. In too many places, I could feel the dismay over inaction of the United Nations or action that was too little or came too late. I am determined to dispel the disillusionment. I earnestly hope that young boys and girls of today will grow up knowing that the United Nations is working hard to build a better future for them. As Secretary-General, I will embrace their hopes and hear their appeals. I am an optimist, and I am full of hope about the future of our global Organization. Let us work together for a United Nations that can deliver more and better.

It is with humility, pride and a great sense of duty that I accept the privilege and the great responsibility of leading our party and changing our country. I will endeavour to justify every day and in every act the trust you have placed in me. Leadership is an awesome responsibility. So let me begin by personally thanking Tony Blair – a man who for ten years has borne the burden of leadership of our country. All of us will remember his leadership – his leadership has made Britain stronger, more tolerant, more prosperous and fairer. And let us never forget his towering presence in the international community, his work on Africa, climate change, his work to win the Olympics for Britain, and the skills and determination he brought to securing peace in Northern Ireland. Tony Blair's achievements are unprecedented, historic and enduring. Tony – on behalf of the Labour party, thank you. And let us also pay tribute to Neil Kinnock – here with us today in Manchester – who led us out of the wilderness years and made it possible for us together to forge New Labour. And John Prescott – for his determination, his strength, his commitment to social justice, and a lifetime of standing up for working people: let us applaud John Prescott. And we know there is a worthy successor in Harriet Harman who has done so much to increase women’s representation in Parliament. As a South East MP, as a working mother herself, Harriet has more consistently than anyone understood the changing pressures on British families – and there is no one who has done more to campaign and deliver for child care, better work life balance, maternity and paternity rights, and for a Britain that values and celebrates families and family life. This week I will form a new government with new priorities to meet the new challenges ahead. And having visited every part of Britain and listened to and learned from the British people, I have seen at first hand a Britain of rising aspiration and I see the need for change to meet new needs. I've met parents in Newcastle wanting more help to balance work and family life, teenagers in Lewisham wanting better chances of education after school, working mothers in Basildon calling for better child care, entrepreneurs in Warwickshire who value economic stability but want help to gain new markets, young couples in every city I’ve visited wanting to buy their first home of their own - men and women who look to us to respond to their hopes for a better life for themselves and their children. Rising aspirations that are no longer just about a basic safety net and basic services, but aspirations that are about higher standards tailored to people’s individual needs. And I have seen also in fast changing communities the new insecurities people feel – and I know we can make changes to address them too. In Liverpool and Cardiff I’ve met pensioners wanting more police on local streets, police and local communities in Birmingham and Glasgow calling for new action on drugs and anti social behaviour, men and women anxious about their jobs, their future and our way of life, and they are yearning for stronger communities. We need to change too to meet the new challenges – climate change, global competition, tackling extremism – and we are learning an inescapable truth: it is only by engaging people in the decisions that matter to their lives, only by a new government building trust by involving the British people, that we as a country will meet the new challenges of 2007 and beyond. So as people's aspirations and priorities change, we the Labour party must renew ourselves as the party of change. Our mission has always been to be the party of progressive change. Our party was born because of a demand for change. We became a governing party because we championed the need for economic and social change. We were reborn under Neil Kinnock, John Smith and Tony Blair because we believed that to change the country we as a party had to change. And once again we are called to be the party of change. And let me tell you the values that will guide me: I grew up in Kirkcaldy, the community I now represent in Parliament. I went to my local school and was one of the people in my class to get to university. When at 16 I suffered an injury at rugby and lost my sight in one eye, I was fortunate enough to have the NHS which saved the sight in my other. And it is for me a matter of fundamental principle that the best education and the best health care I received should be there not only for me and my family, but there for all families in all parts of Britain. All I believe and all I try to do comes from the values that I grew up with: duty, honesty, hard work, family and respect for others. And this is what my parents taught me and will never leave me: that each and everyone of us has a talent, each and everyone of us should have the chance to develop their talent, and that each of us should use whatever talents we have to enable people least able to help themselves. And so I say honestly: I am a conviction politician. My conviction that everyone deserves a fair chance in life. My conviction that each of us has a responsibility to each other. And my conviction that when the strong help the weak, it makes us all stronger. Call it 'the driving power of social conscience', call it 'the better angels of our nature', call it 'our moral sense', call it a belief in 'civic duty'. I joined this party as a teenager because I believed in these values. They guide my work, they are my moral compass. This is who I am. And because these are the values of our party too the party I lead must have more than a set of policies – we must have a soul. Wherever we find opportunity denied, aspirations unfulfilled, potential unrealised; wherever and whenever we find injustice and unfairness, there we must be also – and it is our duty to act. That’s why after the Second World War, in place of fear our party ensured the right to health care – creating the NHS. In place of slums we created the right to decent housing. In the 1960s and 70s in place of prejudice, social reform. In place of poverty in old age new rights to pensions. And then in 1997, in place of unemployment we implemented the vision of full employment. In place of neglect we won the argument for investing in and reforming public services. And it is in this spirit of advancing economic progress and social justice that I wish to serve. So we will build on what has gone right and we will continue our successful reforms, and we learn from where we have not done well enough. I have learned from the difficult decisions we had to make in economic policy that successful progress depends not on quick fixes or taking the easy option –that is not the New Labour way – but on having the strength to take the long term course and see it through. If people think we will achieve our goals in the future by retreating to failed approaches of the past, then they have not learned the lesson I have learned from the last ten years. Half a century ago, housing became a national priority and there was a promise of a property owning democracy, but then unfortunately it was just for a few. Now in 2007, housing will be a priority. The Housing Minister will attend Cabinet and will lead the national debate on the new homes we must build. And this time the promise of a property owning democracy must be open to all those wanting to get on the housing ladder for the first time. And because we need to build new homes not just to own but to rent, we will bring together the private sector, housing associations and local authorities to renew the promise of social housing for our communities. By building new eco towns and villages we will show Labour on the side of aspiration, that new housing can respect our environment too, and that by involving and engaging the British people in a national debate about the future of housing we can make affordable housing for all one of the great causes of our time. Our national mission is to be world class in education – and we will be world class only if we build on our successes by mobilising and engaging not just teachers and parents but the whole community. In the coming weeks the Education Secretary will announce how in support of world class schools we will bring together business, universities, colleges and the voluntary sector. Every secondary school – trusts, specialists or academies – linked to a business, every school linked to a college or university. Step by step we will raise investment in state school pupils – now £5,500 per pupil – to today’s levels for private school pupils: £8,000 a year. For every boy and girl the right to education until 18, reforms to ensure learning personal to their needs, and for every young person the offer of a college or university place or an apprenticeship, or pre-apprenticeship course, as the route to a career. From thousands of children benefiting from Sure Start to thousands staying on to 18, I want for our young people the biggest expansion in educational opportunity our country has ever seen. And we will be truly world class in education only if we raise the aspirations of young people themselves, so we will launch a national campaign for thousands more to stay on at sixteen, to sign up to an apprenticeship, to study at university and college. To those who say more going to university must mean worse standards, let us reply: when in other countries 50 per cent of all their young people already go to university, and in Britain only 40 per cent, and in Britain just 10 per cent from low income backgrounds, now is the time, this is the task: to show education for what it is – what it was for me and so many others; what it must be in the future for more: the great liberating force of our generation. And let me say also that in the fourth richest country in the world it is simply wrong – wrong that any child should grow up in poverty. To address this poverty of income and to address also the poverty of aspirations by better parenting, better schools and more one-to-one support, I want to bring together all the forces of compassion – charities, voluntary sector, local councils so that at the heart of building a better Britain is the cause of ending child poverty. I've spent a lot of time in the last six weeks talking to patients and doctors, nurses and NHS staff. Let me say: every person I have met believes in the principles of our NHS – and like them I am proud that in this generation Britain will uphold an NHS free at the point of use, available to all on the basis of need, not ability to pay. But I know also from everything I have heard round the country, that we need to do better - and the NHS will be my immediate priority. We need to and will do better at ensuring access for patients at the hours that suit them; better at getting basics of food, hygiene and cleanliness right; better at helping people to manage their own health; better at ensuring patients are treated with dignity in the NHS; better at providing the wider range of services now needed by our growing elderly population, and while implementing our essential reforms, better at listening to and valuing our staff. And in the NHS we will also make progress by putting more power locally in the hands of patients and staff. So I propose that as we approach the 60th anniversary of the NHS we discuss a new settlement for a modern NHS free at the point of need – clear about where accountability lies – clear where Government should set overall objectives, clear where it should not interfere, and clear how independently local people should have their voice heard and acted upon in shaping the future of the NHS. And it is right that this party that created the NHS, that has always invested in the NHS, that has always believed in the NHS, will be the party that for the coming generation, renews the NHS. But today we also face all the challenges that globalisation brings. What defines modern Britain is not just peoples rising aspirations but their recognition that the world around us is fragile and uncertain. And for families insecure because they see their communities changing so fast around them, elderly citizens anxious about crime and the British way of life – wanting us to respond not just to their hopes but to answer their fears – I want us to put more power in the hands of the people to make their streets safe and secure. And let us implement the vision: the public informed and consulted, the police supported, and neighbourhood policing in every community of the country. I believe in a British economy founded on dynamic, flexible markets and open competition. But for workers undercut by employers in this country who break the law by paying less than the minimum wage we will act – new protection for vulnerable workers. That's what I mean by safeguarding and advancing the British way of life. And we must be far clearer in speaking up for the common ground upon which we stand – the shared British values of liberty, civic duty and fairness to all. Let us affirm that in return for opportunity for all that we expect and demand responsibility from all: to learn English, contribute to and respect the culture we build together – and not just the hard working majority but everyone must play by the rules. But let us affirm also that no matter your class, colour or creed every individual citizen has the right to rise as far as your talents take you. That is why our way of life is to reject the prejudice and discrimination practised by those who preach xenophobia and racism. Advancing and protecting the British way of life means taking seriously the stewardship of our environment and countryside, building stronger rural communities. And because it matters that people take personal responsibility themselves, we want all individuals and all businesses to join us and build a shared national purpose to make Britain a world leader in tackling climate change. And just as we work with the European Union, America and the rest of the world on global warming, we will also work with them to build the strongest multilateral response to all the security challenges we face. In Iraq, which all of us accept has been a divisive issue for our party and our country, in Afghanistan and in the Middle East, we will meet our international obligations, we will learn lessons that need to be learned, and at all times be unyielding in support for our dedicated armed forces, and resolute in our determination to take the tough decisions to ensure the long term defence and security of our country. Our foreign policy in years ahead will reflect the truth that to isolate and defeat terrorist extremism now involves more than military force – it is also a struggle of ideas and ideals that in the coming years will be waged and won for hearts and minds here at home and round the world. And an essential contribution to this will be what becomes daily more urgent – a Middle East settlement upholding a two state solution, that protects the security of Israel and the legitimate enduring desire for a Palestinian state. Because we all want to address the roots of injustice, I can tell you today that we will strengthen and enhance the work of the department of international development and align aid, debt relief and trade policies to wage an unremitting battle against the poverty, illiteracy, disease and environmental degradation that it has fallen to our generation to eradicate. And just as our policies must change to meet new challenges, so too our party must change. And this time for change for our country must also be a time of renewal for our party. That is why I can announce that the new Deputy Leader will be the Party Chair – from today not appointed by the Leader but elected by the party. And I can also announce that Douglas Alexander will be the General Election Coordinator so that we are ready not just to fight but to win a General Election. All of us share a responsibility to ensure that in the coming years the whole programme of our party is founded on listening to the aspirations of our whole country. It means our membership reaching out to every local community; and it means proper consultation by the leadership with every member. So that is why our National Executive will now consult with members on policy forums in every constituency, leading to a stronger National Policy Forum better able to deal with big issues of the day. And just as we have one member one vote to choose our leaders, we propose that the final decision on the party programme will be made by one member one vote. And it is time for a new and better relationship between government and the British people – with government the servant and more power in the hands of the people. That's why constitutional reform matters directly to me and to all our lives – because all the big challenges we face: the environment, raising education standards, building better communities – can only be met by directly involving and engaging the British people in their solution. I tell you: the power of government can never substitute for the empowerment of people. The days of Whitehall ever thinking it knows best are over. We need government that does not overreach but reaches out; government as servant at all times putting opportunity in the hands of people. That's why I want a new constitutional settlement for Britain. And the principles of my reforms are these: Government giving more power to Parliament; both government and Parliament giving more power to the people; Parliament voting on all the major issues of our time including peace and war; civil liberties safeguarded and enhanced; devolution within a Union of nations: England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland – a Union that I believe in and will defend; local government strengthened with new powers – local communities empowered to hold those who make the decisions to account; and with community ownership of assets – greater power for more people to control their lives. Government putting our trust in the people – and we will renew people's trust in government. And our local democracy strengthened by citizens’ forums and new citizens juries where citizens and their representatives have the chance to fully debate the concerns that matter to them. And I've learned something else about how we can change our country – how we can build a progressive consensus. In the last ten years, from make poverty history to campaigns on disability, gay rights and the environment, Britain has changed for the better, not just because of government, but because of movements that have gone beyond traditional parties, captured people’s imaginations and transformed people’s lives. As a party we have always known that we succeed best when we reach out to and engage the whole community. So here I stand proud of our Labour party but determined that we reach out to all people who can be persuaded to share our values and who would like to be part of building a more just society. So my message today is also to people who want to change from the old politics, who yearn for a public life founded on values, who are inspired by what we as nation can now achieve together – join us. Join us in building the Britain we believe in. And don't let anyone tell you the choice at the next election will be change with other parties and no change with Labour. Because when I take office on Wednesday I will, as our party has always done, heed and lead the call of change. So for young people wanting the first step on the housing ladder to their first home, we will meet the challenge of change. For families wanting their sons and daughters to get the chance of college or university, we will meet the challenge of change. For parents wanting affordable child care, we will meet the challenge of change. For families and pensioners who want an NHS there when they need it, we will meet the challenge of change. For people wanting a stronger democracy, we will meet the challenge of change. And we will govern for all the people of our country. This week marks a new start A chance to renew. And I say to the people of Britain: The new government I will lead belongs to you. I will work hard for you. I shall always try my utmost. I am ready to serve."
10355,"Srgjan Kerim, PGA Inauguration Speech",http://undocs.org/en/A/62/PV.1,Srgjan Kerim,President of the General Assembly,Inauguration Speech,2007,,"The President: Mr. Secretary-General, Excellencies, distinguished guests, friends: it is my privilege and honour to welcome all of you to the sixty-second session of the General Assembly. I would like to thank you all for your contributions towards the work programme for this session. You have asked me to show leadership, and I will do it. Before outlining the major priorities for this session, I would first like to congratulate President Al-Khalifa for her energetic and honest leadership during the sixty-first session. I would particularly like to commend her for the thematic debates she convened. I intend to develop that practice and widen our global outreach. I would also like to thank Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his close support during the transition period. Together we will continue to work with common purpose to renew, modernize and strengthen the Organization so that it can rise to the challenges of the twenty-first century. More than ever before, global challenges demand multilateral solutions. The United Nations is the appropriate multilateral forum to take action. That is why the revitalization of the General Assembly deserves our greatest attention. To revitalize this House is also to renew our faith in each other, our common values and destiny. True revitalization will only happen if together we address, among other things, the five priority issues that, in consultation with the Member States, I have identified: climate change, financing for development, achieving the Millennium Development Goals, countering terrorism, and the reform agenda to renew the management, effectiveness and coherence of the Organization. (spoke in French) Climate change will be the first of the five priority issues on which the Assembly will focus. The challenges posed by climate change are so far-reaching and their impacts so dramatic and varied that we cannot afford to wait any longer. Science has spoken, and the time to act has come. On 24 September 2007, heads of State will have an opportunity to demonstrate their commitment in this regard here at the United Nations, for the United Nations will be the main stage for debate and action. Only a global forum can meet a global problem. The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, which is the keystone of our efforts, will be supplemented by other ongoing initiatives. I hope that the General Assembly will make a considerable contribution to the debate by strengthening political will and cohesion. However, climate change is not just a matter of the environment; in itself it clearly illustrates the major linkages between environmental problems and development issues. Development will be sustainable or it will not. It requires both broad participation on the part of all stakeholders —especially non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and the private sector — and better international environmental governance. That leads me to the issue of development, which is the second pillar that I would like to address as a matter of priority during the sixty-second session. Time is against us. The Millennium Development Goals (MDG) will not, for the most part, be reached, especially in Africa. We are facing an emergency situation today. I ask Member States to provide us with the means to address it. (spoke in English) Financing for development is a priority. I will convene an informal meeting of the plenary on 20 September to discuss innovative approaches and preparations for the high-level dialogue. I also appeal for the ongoing support of Member States as we move on to Doha in 2008. It is also imperative during the sixty-second session that we comprehensively review progress on the implementation of the Millennium Development Goals. Achieving the MDGs is not solely a test of our ability to deliver on our promises; it is, above all, a test of our moral obligations and the values that are enshrined in the Charter. That is why, in consultation with the Secretary-General, I intend to work closely with heads of State and Government to hold an MDG leaders’ meeting here at the United Nations during this session. Because global action is urgently needed, the high-level events on children and HIV/AIDS, and progress to strengthen the Organization’s gender equality architecture, will take on additional significance. The General Assembly must take the initiative and strengthen its central position in the multilateral system. We must use every opportunity to spread our message. We must forge a lasting consensus — a global alliance for action — by bringing together Member States, the private sector, NGOs and civil society. In doing so, we can also help to overcome the underlying misunderstanding between cultures and religions that is at the core of many of today’s problems. In that context, the High-level Dialogue on Interreligious and Intercultural Understanding and Cooperation for Peace will provide an additional opportunity. We can further support those objectives and promote human security by strengthening the Peacebuilding Commission and making progress on the disarmament agenda. By promoting peace, human rights and the rule of law we can make the world a fairer and more equitable place. Progress on those issues and on development will reduce instability and the threat of terrorism. That is a win-win situation for us all. Reviewing the implementation of the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy will also be a priority during this session. We need to ensure that we are properly prepared both as an Organization and within our national jurisdictions. I also call on all members to make substantive progress on the terrorism convention and to send a strong signal that we stand united in confronting terrorism. If we want the United Nations to play its full role, we will have to do more and do it more effectively — both operationally at the country level and with regard to management at Headquarters. We also need the courage to move to a new stage leading to concrete results on Security Council reform. Together, we have to further strengthen the Organization’s capabilities. As President Al-Khalifa recognized, we are confronted with widening gaps in our ability to deliver on important issues — issues that are vital not only to the future relevance of the Organization but also to the global public that we serve. Modernizing our management and implementing greater coherence across the system will enable the Organization to deliver better results on all the priorities I have outlined. To achieve that we all have a responsibility to seek out bold compromises. We must strive to build a system of international relations based on multilateral cooperation, mutual respect and international law. We can achieve that only through open and transparent working practices. That is the only way I know of to build lasting political consensus. May I thank you once again for the responsibility and trust that you have placed in me. I can assure you that I stand ready to serve the values and principles of the Organization. As we take our first steps together at this session, I would like to leave you to consider the wise words of George Bernard Shaw: “I don’t believe in circumstances. The people who get on in this world are the people who get up and look for the circumstances they want, and, if they can’t find them, make them.” (Mrs. Warren’s Profession, Act II) In the coming months, I will count on your wholehearted support to create the circumstances we need as, together, we chart the course that this Organization must take to build bridges towards a better future."
10362,"Miguel d'Escoto Brockmann, PGA Inauguration Speech",http://undocs.org/en/A/63/PV.1,Miguel d'Escoto Brockmann,President of the General Assembly,Inauguration Speech,2008,,"The President (spoke in Spanish): Fortunately, communication goes beyond the spoken word and its limitations, especially in this twenty-first century, which has been called the age of the image. I would therefore like to begin my statement with a brief multimedia introduction, using the tools that technology has given us, and I invite members to watch a short video. A video was displayed in the General Assembly Hall. The President (spoke in Spanish): And now let us return to communicating in the more traditional form of words. I come before the Assembly today fully aware of the complexity of the responsibility I assumed in accepting the presidency of this sixty-third session of the General Assembly, which you, the members, have so generously entrusted to me. Despite the relative insignificance to which the General Assembly has been relegated in recent years, I firmly believe that the task of presiding over this General Assembly is an important one. It becomes even more significant when this post strives to transform the prevailing exclusionary logic of selfishness that has, at times, crippled the ability of this body to fulfil its mandate as enshrined in the United Nations Charter. Left unchecked, this logic can only lead us to death and the extinction of our own species. The logic of selfishness must be replaced with the logic of love, of inclusiveness, of “we” and “our”, of solidarity. The struggle for the full acceptance of the logic of solidarity in both our Organization and in its Member States will be the principal endeavour of this presidency. The state of our world today is deplorable, inexcusable and therefore shameful. What Tolstoy denounced as “mad selfishness” explains why, as trillions of dollars are spent on wars of aggression, more than half the world’s people languish in hunger and destitution. Our priorities, my dear brothers and sisters, could hardly be more confused. All of us, without exception, share responsibility for the state of the world today. While some are undoubtedly more responsible than others, there is no point in arguing over our different degrees of responsibility. What is important at this point is that we look to the future, learning from our past mistakes, and together embark wholeheartedly on the task of building a new and better world, a resolute world, in the conviction that another world is possible. The situation in which our world finds itself is even more serious today than it was 63 years ago when the United Nations was founded. Nevertheless, we are not fatally condemned to continue sinking into the morass of mad, suicidal selfishness in which we find ourselves. In order to escape from that morass, we have only to recognize that we are all sisters and brothers and that the truth of that fact demands that we change our way of thinking, behaving and interacting with one another. At this point in the odyssey of human existence, that is the central truth. Our acceptance of that truth and of its logical consequences will determine whether coming generations will have a decent future. Love prompts us to take action in the construction of a more just and non-violent world, with solidarity as its most important feature. We must do so without looking back and while seeking reconciliation with all those who might have caused us pain and suffering. If we cannot forgive, we will not be deserving of life. We will have opted for hate and rancour, which lead only to destruction and death. In addition to the capacity to forgive, we must all once again think of ourselves as stewards of planet Earth. Little by little, we humans, especially those of us in the West, have rebelled against our vocation of stewardship, our reason for being. We have increasingly become arrogant landlords, believing that we have absolute rights over what has been entrusted to our care and management for the good of all. That is the suicidal madness in which we find ourselves. Wake-up calls, whatever their form and no matter how brotherly their spirit, always make some people uncomfortable. However, in view of the dangerous excesses of human behaviour, these wake-up calls are imperative. The basic problem is one of ethics. Simply stated, we are not treating each other or the natural world as we should. My call for us to embrace the supreme law of love, without exceptions or exclusions, for the sake of present and future generations, is made on the understanding that what gives meaning to human existence is the never-ending process of more and more dedication to the service of our fellow beings and to universal solidarity. In that process of transformation, all religions and ethical-philosophical systems can and should help us. Although for me personally the paradigm of life-giving and redemptive behaviour is in the Cross, I am convinced that all of us, in our respective religious, cultural and ethical-philosophical traditions, find a strong summons to embrace the logic of love and solidarity. We must all jointly endeavour to turn that summons into the main propelling force for humankind and for the United Nations. Love for each other and for our Earth should ground our interdependence and guide our collective activity. At this very difficult time for humankind, our Organization has a major role to play and an obligation to prepare itself to perform better. The central and overarching objective of the sixty-third session of the General Assembly will be to democratize the United Nations. In so doing, we will ensure that the United Nations maintains its place as the world’s most important and indispensable organization for achieving the levels of peace and security that our peoples are rightly demanding of us. I am aware of the great expectations that the vast majority of the dispossessed inhabitants of our threatened planet have placed in the United Nations to bring them peace and security and to defend their right to life and full development. We must not fail them. It was most of all for the dispossessed of the world that I took up the challenge of presiding over the sixty-third session of the General Assembly. It is to them — to all our dispossessed sisters and brothers on Earth — that I dedicate my presidency. We must unite our efforts, with all the seriousness that the task requires, to meet their expectations. I trust that I can count on the generous cooperation of all members. On behalf of Nicaragua and the entire Latin American and Caribbean region, my extended homeland, I thank members for their confidence. I should now like to turn to the issues of hunger, poverty and high oil and food prices. Various largescale crises — economic, financial, environmental, humanitarian and legal — are converging in the present world crisis in food prices. These crises are reflected in the current turbulence and distortion in credit markets, subsidized oil prices, the rise in world food prices and rising prices in general, and are aggravated even further by economic stagnation. Each one of those crises interacts with the others, exponentially aggravating the deterioration in the world economy. As much as authorities and the media strive to minimize the gravity of the current situation, the truth is that we find ourselves before a global economic upheaval of unprecedented magnitude. As a result, today we are in serious danger of suffering setbacks in the fight against hunger and poverty, including the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) to reduce extreme poverty. At the root of the problem of world hunger is the unequal distribution of purchasing power within and between countries. Rather than concentrating on increasing food production as the sole solution, the central focus of our efforts should be on reducing the inequalities in the world’s food production system. If we are to deal effectively with the problem of hunger, Governments will need to take the courageous decisions that the crisis requires of them, including reorienting their own national priorities, transcending local and national confines to take into account the greater good and the well-being of the world’s poor. We must demonstrate our readiness to tackle even the most sensitive and contentious of issues. That means addressing, for example, the market distortions caused by the agricultural subsidies of developed countries; the impact of speculation on futures markets; the impacts of climate change on food production and the environment; the multiple impacts of the production of biofuels; and last but not least, the problematic development model imposed on developing countries by the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. If we are to eradicate extreme poverty and hunger from this Earth, the General Assembly, in addition to determining the real needs in terms of the types and amounts of international cooperation required, will have to meet the challenge of fostering strong feelings of solidarity in order to awaken the necessary political will among all our Member States. During the sixty-third session, we will therefore examine the immediate and root causes of the world food crisis and its impact on world hunger and poverty. And for that reason, I welcome the declaration of the ministerial meeting of the Non-Aligned Movement held in Tehran in late July 2008, calling for a meeting at the highest level to deal with the theme of food security and to identify immediate and medium-term actions to resolve that crisis. It is also imperative that we deal with the root causes that limit the institutional capacity of our own General Assembly, such as, first, non-observance of the principles and standards laid down in the Charter; secondly, the growing tendency to deprive the General Assembly of any real power; thirdly, the reduction of the Economic and Social Council to a peripheral body; and fourthly, the transfer of ever more power to the Security Council and the Bretton Woods institutions, as well as to other international finance and trade institutions in general. In other words, it is precisely in the lack of democracy within our Organization where we find the most profound cause for the most serious problems in our world today. On the democratization of the United Nations, without a doubt, a United Nations enriched by genuine input from all its Members would make our Organization the ideal forum for dealing effectively with the world’s most pressing problems and for preventing a few from imposing upon the majority courses of action that only make matters worse. For that reason, we have concluded that it has become imperative to hold a high-level dialogue on the democratization of the United Nations. At the sixty-third session of the General Assembly, we will hold this dialogue in three five-day sessions. The first session will concern the indispensable coordination of the Bretton Woods and other international financial and commercial institutions with the Economic and Social Council and the General Assembly. The Bretton Woods institutions were established for the very purpose of addressing the inequity of extreme poverty and helping to rebuild the world economy. But all too often they have been used to impose ill-advised prescriptions that have only made the problem of poverty worse instead of helping to resolve it. While they are not United Nations bodies in the strictest sense, the Bretton Woods institutions are among the specialized agencies referred to in Articles 57 and 63 of the Charter, which are to be brought into relationship with the Organization on terms defined by agreement with the Economic and Social Council. Both the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank are basically controlled by the United States and Europe. Both institutions have been and continue to be used as instruments of domination. The world resents this, and this situation must change. The necessary democratization of those international financial institutions requires a change in the system of shares and the system for electing the respective boards of directors. The second session of this high-level dialogue of the General Assembly will be devoted to a discussion of the revitalization and empowerment of the Assembly itself through the transfer to this body of the power wrongly accumulated in the Security Council, the Bretton Woods institutions and even, believe it or not, in the bureaucracy of our Organization. At the United Nations, the word “democracy” is becoming increasingly empty, with no real meaning or substance. Even with a majority as overwhelming as 184 votes to 4 against the 45-year-old United States embargo against Cuba — and we see such votes year after year — that patently unjust and universally repudiated embargo remains firmly in place. If the opinion of more than 95 per cent of the membership of the United Nations can be so casually ignored, of what use is this General Assembly? That is a question that deserves some thought. How can we be content to say that we have democracy simply because we have the “one nation, one vote” rule? What good are votes if they are ignored? In any event, it is clear that we all must wholeheartedly embrace the universal call for a strengthened and empowered General Assembly, which can only be achieved through the democratization of the United Nations. We know that fighting the powers that be has never been easy, but we also know that the future of the United Nations will depend on our success in the struggle for its democratization — that is, on our capacity to persuade some of the powerful to free themselves of their unbridled ambition for more and more power, at the expense of the rights of the majority. We will continue to stress that the democratization that the United Nations so urgently needs will entail decentralizing the power accumulated in a small group of States and in the Organization’s own bureaucracy and transferring that power to the General Assembly, where it logically belongs. That is an urgent task: the world cannot afford to wait another 15 years listening to speeches that lead nowhere. It is time, brothers and sisters, to act. It is all well and good to preach democracy, but it would be better still for us to put it into practice, right here at the United Nations. It makes no sense to wage wars of aggression that kill hundreds of thousands of people with the purported aim of supporting democracy, while at the same time using every imaginable means and pretext to prevent the democratization of the United Nations itself. In addition, the General Assembly should become more proactive, and its resolutions should be binding. The idea that the clear and unequivocal voice of “We the peoples” should be regarded as a mere recommendation with no binding power should be buried forever in our anti-democratic past. The third and final session of the high-level dialogue on the democratization of the United Nations will be devoted to a frank discussion of the Security Council. Many areas of the United Nations system are in urgent need of attention, and chief among them is the Security Council. It is a sad but undeniable fact that serious breaches of and threats to international peace and security are being perpetrated by some members of the Security Council that are unable to break what appears to be their addiction to war. In the case of some of those members, the veto privilege seems to have gone to their heads and confused them to the point of making them think that they are entitled to do as they please without consequence. The first principle of the United Nations, the one upon which our Organization is based, is the principle of the sovereign equality of all its Members. The second principle is that all Members — all Members — shall fulfil in good faith the obligations assumed by them in accordance with the present Charter. In other words, any attempt by a Member State to put itself above the Charter is a serious offence against the membership and constitutes a threat to peace. Guaranteeing respect for those principles can no longer be postponed. As difficult as that may be, solving the problem of the Security Council is a challenge we have to take up. I am well aware that by saying this I am stirring up a hornets’ nest, but even hornets can be managed successfully if due precautions are taken. I propose that, at the sixty-third session of the General Assembly, we seriously consider what those precautions should be. We hope that today, after all that has happened in the world since the United Nations was founded, our most powerful sister nations will be willing to give peace and democracy a chance. In any event, it should be borne in mind that privileges granted by law on the assumption that they are reasonable and for the common good remain valid only as long as that assumption holds true. I think we all agree that merely increasing the number of members or of countries with the privileges of permanent membership or the power of veto in the Security Council would in no way address the core issue. While it is necessary to ensure fairer and more geographically balanced representation, increasing the number of Security Council members would do nothing to correct the anomalies that we should be trying to rectify. In addition to the themes of hunger, poverty and high oil and food prices and the high-level dialogue on the democratization of the United Nations, to be held in three sessions as I have just explained, at the sixtythird session the General Assembly will devote special attention to the following major themes which, for the sake of brevity, I shall now simply outline. I invite all members, however, to review the full text of my presentation, which is now available in all the working languages of the Organization. Each theme is closely related to the lack of democracy at the United Nations and is considered to be of the utmost urgency. Today, there is scientific consensus on the human origins of climate change, especially following last year’s publication of the fourth assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The report concludes and asserts that global warming is unequivocal and that tangible solutions are needed to address it. The adoption of the Bali Action Plan constitutes an important step in that direction. It is imperative that the value of tropical forests as important carbon sinks be recognized and that the countries historically responsible for climate change pay fair incentives for their conservation. We must not forget that deforestation, which causes 20 per cent of greenhouse gas emissions, is largely a consequence of the extreme poverty of small farmers in developing countries. Water is not a commodity to be bought and sold. It is a fundamental right that must be recognized as one of the goals of the International Decade for Action, “Water for Life”. The World Bank reports that, by 2025, two thirds of the world’s population will not have enough clean water. We need to join forces and resources to take immediate steps to protect the sources of that precious resource, improve measures to prevent water pollution and alert peoples to the impending crisis, which threatens the lives and well-being of hundreds of millions, if not billions, of human beings. With respect to terrorism and human rights, no State should appropriate the right to decide on its own which States are terrorists or sponsors of terrorism and which are not. Less still should States that are guilty of wars of aggression — the worst form of terrorism imaginable — presume to arrogate that right to themselves and take any unilateral action they may deem appropriate. For that reason, we insist that it is time for the General Assembly to embark, with all due seriousness, on a discussion of international terrorism, including its definition and the assignment of responsibilities for dealing with it. That is a task, my dear sisters and brothers, that cannot wait. General and complete disarmament is one of the fundamental objectives of the United Nations. Yet, that urgent issue has been pushed into the background and has not received the kind of follow-up it deserves. The mere presence of 4,600 nuclear warheads on high alert poses intolerable risks to international security, since accidental launches can always occur. Each year this body adopts over 50 resolutions and decisions on those issues. Yet, something is missing from our deliberations — the effective implementation of our decisions by constructive action. 
This presidency will call upon all Member States at the sixty-third session to adopt a results-based approach both to disarmament and to the regulation of conventional armaments. Progress in that important area, as in all others, must be measured by deeds and not only by words or numbers of resolutions. Human trafficking, the situation of Palestine, humanitarian assistance and gender equality are other issues to which we will give special and priority attention. Similarly, in considering the various aforementioned themes, we should devote special attention to the most vulnerable, including most especially children in situations of armed conflict or humanitarian disaster. Our efforts in that area must not be limited to the provision of shelter, clothing and food, but rather focus special attention on their right to education. In conclusion, today more than ever before, candour is indispensable in international relations. I would like this sixty-third session of the General Assembly to go down in history as the “Assembly of candour” for the sake of world peace and the eradication of poverty and hunger from the Earth. Considering the seriousness of the global crises, diffident and ambiguous language will get us nowhere. The United Nations can effectively tackle the deeprooted and urgent problems of the day only by doing so clearly, firmly and unequivocally. Sugar-coating, speaking euphemistically or engaging in petty semantics so as not to call things by their name, all on the basis of an erroneous concept of diplomacy, has never worked and will never work. The world crisis is too serious to allow for euphemisms or half measures. Change — real, credible change — is the watchword of the day. Even more than political will, we will need to summon great spiritual strength to carry out the changes needed to democratize the United Nations. That, in turn, will strengthen the Organization’s capacity to contribute with growing effectiveness to the supreme cause of peace in our world. However, knowing that we are in need of great spiritual strength must not discourage us — it is within our reach. All persons and nations without exception possess enormous reserves of human nobility. It is time for us to tap into the reserves of moral strength within each of us as individuals and within all of us as nations. If we do so, our hearts and our capacity to love and serve will grow and we will find ourselves better able to bring our great human family to new levels of solidarity that guarantee to all of us, and to generations to come, a future of enduring peace. Let us put to rest forever the unhealthy aspiration of dominance of one over the other. Let us free ourselves, too, from our addiction to war and violence in general. Imperial dreams and behaviour are incompatible with the principles to which we have all committed ourselves within the Charter and with the ideal of a world at peace in international security. Let us work together now to make a truly United Nations — united, fraternal and joined in solidarity. Now is the time for all of us to begin the process of turning weapons into ploughshares to feed a world languishing in hunger and poverty. Let Gandhi be for us not only someone to whom we render tribute in speeches and declarations but, more importantly, a paradigm that we try to emulate. Let us honour his global legacy by putting the greater good of our shared humanity at the forefront of our collective endeavour to build a world community at peace with itself and in harmony with Mother Earth, our vast shared home. Let us give genuine democracy and peace a chance. Let us conduct ourselves as the people we are — all sisters and brothers, reconciled with one another and committed to living in non-violence and solidarity. A democratized United Nations will be the indispensable tool for achieving those lofty goals. I should like to end as we began. On this occasion, I invite representatives to hear a song. I believe it is an appropriate way to end my opening statement. The members of the General Assembly heard a musical performance. "
10363,"Barack Obama, Presidential Inauguration Speech",https://avalon.law.yale.edu/21st_century/obama.asp,Barack Obama,President (United States),Inauguration Speech,2009,,"My fellow citizens:

I stand here today humbled by the task before us, grateful for the trust you have bestowed, mindful of the sacrifices borne by our ancestors. I thank President Bush for his service to our nation, as well as the generosity and cooperation he has shown throughout this transition.

Forty-four Americans have now taken the presidential oath. The words have been spoken during rising tides of prosperity and the still waters of peace. Yet, every so often the oath is taken amidst gathering clouds and raging storms. At these moments, America has carried on not simply because of the skill or vision of those in high office, but because We the People have remained faithful to the ideals of our forbearers, and true to our founding documents.

So it has been. So it must be with this generation of Americans. That we are in the midst of crisis is now well understood. Our nation is at war, against a far-reaching network of violence and hatred. Our economy is badly weakened, a consequence of greed and irresponsibility on the part of some, but also our collective failure to make hard choices and prepare the nation for a new age. Homes have been lost; jobs shed; businesses shuttered. Our healthcare is too costly; our schools fail too many; and each day brings further evidence that the ways we use energy strengthen our adversaries and threaten our planet.

These are the indicators of crisis, subject to data and statistics. Less measurable but no less profound is a sapping of confidence across our land; a nagging fear that America's decline is inevitable, and that the next generation must lower its sights.

Today I say to you that the challenges we face are real. They are serious and they are many. They will not be met easily or in a short span of time. But know this, America: they will be met.

On this day, we gather because we have chosen hope over fear, unity of purpose over conflict and discord.

On this day, we come to proclaim an end to the petty grievances and false promises, the recriminations and worn out dogmas, that for far too long have strangled our politics.

We remain a young nation, but in the words of Scripture, the time has come to set aside childish things. The time has come to reaffirm our enduring spirit; to choose our better history; to carry forward that precious gift, that noble idea, passed on from generation to generation: the God-given promise that all are equal, all are free, and all deserve a chance to pursue their full measure of happiness.

In reaffirming the greatness of our nation, we understand that greatness is never a given. It must be earned. Our journey has never been one of shortcuts or settling for less. It has not been the path for the faint-hearted, for those who prefer leisure over work, or seek only the pleasures of riches and fame. Rather, it has been the risk-takers, the doers, the makers of things - some celebrated, but more often men and women obscure in their labor, who have carried us up the long, rugged path towards prosperity and freedom.

For us, they packed up their few worldly possessions and traveled across oceans in search of a new life.

For us, they toiled in sweatshops and settled the West; endured the lash of the whip and plowed the hard earth.

For us, they fought and died, in places like Concord and Gettysburg; Normandy and Khe Sahn.

Time and again these men and women struggled and sacrificed and worked till their hands were raw so that we might live a better life. They saw America as bigger than the sum of our individual ambitions; greater than all the differences of birth or wealth or faction.

This is the journey we continue today. We remain the most prosperous, powerful nation on Earth. Our workers are no less productive than when this crisis began. Our minds are no less inventive, our goods and services no less needed than they were last week or last month or last year. Our capacity remains undiminished. But our time of standing pat, of protecting narrow interests and putting off unpleasant decisions -- that time has surely passed. Starting today, we must pick ourselves up, dust ourselves off, and begin again the work of remaking America.

For everywhere we look, there is work to be done. The state of the economy calls for action, bold and swift, and we will act not only to create new jobs, but to lay a new foundation for growth. We will build the roads and bridges, the electric grids and digital lines that feed our commerce and bind us together. We will restore science to its rightful place, and wield technology's wonders to raise healthcare's quality and lower its cost. We will harness the sun and the winds and the soil to fuel our cars and run our factories. And we will transform our schools and colleges and universities to meet the demands of a new age. All this we can do. And all this we will do.

Now, there are some who question the scale of our ambitions -- who suggest that our system cannot tolerate too many big plans. Their memories are short. For they have forgotten what this country has already done; what free men and women can achieve when imagination is joined to common purpose, and necessity to courage.

What the cynics fail to understand is that the ground has shifted beneath them - that the stale political arguments that have consumed us for so long no longer apply. The question we ask today is not whether our government is too big or too small, but whether it works - whether it helps families find jobs at a decent wage, care they can afford, a retirement that is dignified. Where the answer is yes, we intend to move forward. Where the answer is no, programs will end. And those of us who manage the public's dollars will be held to account - to spend wisely, reform bad habits, and do our business in the light of day - because only then can we restore the vital trust between a people and their government.

Nor is the question before us whether the market is a force for good or ill. Its power to generate wealth and expand freedom is unmatched, but this crisis has reminded us that without a watchful eye, the market can spin out of control and that a nation cannot prosper long when it favors only the prosperous. The success of our economy has always depended not just on the size of our Gross Domestic Product, but on the reach of our prosperity; on our ability to extend opportunity to every willing heart - not out of charity, but because it is the surest route to our common good.

As for our common defense, we reject as false the choice between our safety and our ideals. Our Founding Fathers, faced with perils we can scarcely imagine, drafted a charter to assure the rule of law and the rights of man, a charter expanded by the blood of generations. Those ideals still light the world, and we will not give them up for expedience's sake. And so to all other peoples and governments who are watching today, from the grandest capitals to the small village where my father was born: know that America is a friend of each nation and every man, woman, and child who seeks a future of peace and dignity, and that we are ready to lead once more.

Recall that earlier generations faced down fascism and communism not just with missiles and tanks, but with sturdy alliances and enduring convictions. They understood that our power alone cannot protect us, nor does it entitle us to do as we please. Instead, they knew that our power grows through its prudent use; our security emanates from the justness of our cause, the force of our example, the tempering qualities of humility and restraint.

We are the keepers of this legacy. Guided by these principles once more, we can meet those new threats that demand even greater effort, even greater cooperation and understanding between nations. We will begin to responsibly leave Iraq to its people, and forge a hard-earned peace in Afghanistan. With old friends and former foes, we will work tirelessly to lessen the nuclear threat, and roll back the specter of a warming planet. We will not apologize for our way of life, nor will we waver in its defense, and for those who seek to advance their aims by inducing terror and slaughtering innocents, we say to you now that our spirit is stronger and cannot be broken; you cannot outlast us, and we will defeat you.

For we know that our patchwork heritage is a strength, not a weakness. We are a nation of Christians and Muslims, Jews and Hindus, and non-believers. We are shaped by every language and culture, drawn from every end of this Earth; and because we have tasted the bitter swill of civil war and segregation, and emerged from that dark chapter stronger and more united, we cannot help but believe that the old hatreds shall someday pass; that the lines of tribe shall soon dissolve; that as the world grows smaller, our common humanity shall reveal itself; and that America must play its role in ushering in a new era of peace.

To the Muslim world, we seek a new way forward, based on mutual interest and mutual respect. To those leaders around the globe who seek to sow conflict, or blame their society's ills on the West, know that your people will judge you on what you can build, not what you destroy. To those who cling to power through corruption and deceit and the silencing of dissent, know that you are on the wrong side of history; but that we will extend a hand if you are willing to unclench your fist.

To the people of poor nations, we pledge to work alongside you to make your farms flourish and let clean waters flow; to nourish starved bodies and feed hungry minds. And to those nations like ours that enjoy relative plenty, we say we can no longer afford indifference to suffering outside our borders; nor can we consume the world's resources without regard to effect. For the world has changed, and we must change with it.

As we consider the road that unfolds before us, we remember with humble gratitude those brave Americans who, at this very hour, patrol far-off deserts and distant mountains. They have something to tell us today, just as the fallen heroes who lie in Arlington whisper through the ages. We honor them not only because they are guardians of our liberty, but because they embody the spirit of service: a willingness to find meaning in something greater than themselves. And yet, at this moment, a moment that will define a generation, it is precisely this spirit that must inhabit us all.

For as much as government can do and must do, it is ultimately the faith and determination of the American people upon which this nation relies. It is the kindness to take in a stranger when the levees break, the selflessness of workers who would rather cut their hours than see a friend lose their job, which sees us through our darkest hours. It is the firefighter's courage to storm a stairway filled with smoke, but also a parent's willingness to nurture a child, that finally decides our fate.

Our challenges may be new. The instruments with which we meet them may be new. But those values upon which our success depends - hard work and honesty, courage and fair play, tolerance and curiosity, loyalty and patriotism - these things are old. These things are true. They have been the quiet force of progress throughout our history. What is demanded then is a return to these truths. What is required of us now is a new era of responsibility - a recognition, on the part of every American, that we have duties to ourselves, our nation, and the world, duties that we do not grudgingly accept but rather seize gladly, firm in the knowledge that there is nothing so satisfying to the spirit, so defining of our character, than giving our all to a difficult task.

This is the price and the promise of citizenship.

This is the source of our confidence: the knowledge that God calls on us to shape an uncertain destiny.

This is the meaning of our liberty and our creed, why men and women and children of every race and every faith can join in celebration across this magnificent mall, and why a man whose father less than 60 years ago might not have been served at a local restaurant can now stand before you to take a most sacred oath.

So let us mark this day with remembrance, of who we are and how far we have traveled. In the year of America's birth, in the coldest of months, a small band of patriots huddled by dying campfires on the shores of an icy river. The capital was abandoned. The enemy was advancing. The snow was stained with blood. At a moment when the outcome of our revolution was most in doubt, the father of our nation ordered these words be read to the people:

""Let it be told to the future world that in the depth of winter, when nothing but hope and virtue could survive that the city and the country, alarmed at one common danger, came forth to meet it.""

America. In the face of our common dangers, in this winter of our hardship, let us remember these timeless words. With hope and virtue, let us brave once more the icy currents, and endure what storms may come. Let it be said by our children's children that when we were tested we refused to let this journey end, that we did not turn back, nor did we falter; and with eyes fixed on the horizon and God's grace upon us, we carried forth that great gift of freedom and delivered it safely to future generations.

Thank you. God bless you.

And God bless the United States of America."
10364,"Angela Merkel, Chancellor Inauguration Speech",https://www.german-way.com/notable-people/featured-bios/angela-merkel/angela-merkels-2009-speech-to-the-us-congress/,Angela Merkel,Chancellor (Germany),Inauguration Speech,2009,,"Madam Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Distinguished Members of Congress,
I would like to thank you for the great honor and privilege to address you today, shortly before the 20th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall.
I am the second German chancellor on whom this honor has been bestowed. The first was Konrad Adenauer when he addressed both Houses of Congress in 1957, albeit one after the other.
Our lives could not have been more different. In 1957 I was just a small child of three years. I lived with my parents in Brandenburg, a region that belonged to the German Democratic Republic (GDR), the part of Germany that was not free. My father was a Protestant pastor. My mother, who had studied English and Latin to become a teacher, was not allowed to work in her chosen profession in the GDR.
In 1957 Konrad Adenauer was already 81 years old. He had lived through the German Empire, the First World War, the Weimar Republic and the Second World War. The National Socialists ousted him from his position as mayor of the city of Cologne. After the war, he was among the men and women who helped build up the free, democratic Federal Republic of Germany.
Nothing is more symbolic of the Federal Republic of Germany than its constitution, the Basic Law, or Grundgesetz. It was adopted exactly 60 years ago. Article 1 of the Grundgesetz proclaims, and I quote, “Human dignity shall be inviolable.” This short, simple sentence – “Human dignity shall be inviolable” – was the answer to the catastrophe that was the Second World War, to the murder of six million Jews in the Holocaust, to the hate, destruction and annihilation that Germany brought upon Europe and the world.
November 9th is just a few days away. It was on November 9, 1989 that the Berlin Wall fell and it was also on November 9 in 1938 that an indelible mark was branded into Germany’s memory and Europe’s history. On that day the National Socialists destroyed synagogues, setting them on fire, and murdered countless people. It was the beginning of what led to the break with civilization, the Shoah. I cannot stand before you today without remembering the victims of this day and of the Shoah.
And I cannot stand before you today without mentioning how grateful I am for the presence of one guest, who personally experienced the horror of National Socialism in Germany and whom I recently met personally: Professor Fritz Stern.
He was born in 1926 in what was then the German city of Breslau and today is the Polish city of Wroclaw. He and his family were able to escape the Nazi regime in 1938 and flee to the United States. In his autobiography, published in 2006 under the title Five Germanys I Have Known, Fritz Stern describes the moment of his arrival in New York’s harbor in 1938, a haven of freedom and security.
Ladies and gentlemen, it is wonderful that history willed that we should both – the twelve-year-old boy who was driven out of Germany and me, the Chancellor of reunited Germany who was born in the GDR – be here in this distinguished House. This fills me with great joy and deep gratitude.
Not even in my wildest dreams could I have imagined, twenty years ago before the Wall fell, that this would happen. It was beyond imagination then to even think about traveling to the United States of America let alone standing here today.
The land of unlimited opportunity – for a long time it was impossible for me to reach. The Wall, barbed wire and the order to shoot those who tried to leave limited my access to the free world. So I had to create my own picture of the United States from films and books, some of which were smuggled in from the West by relatives. What did I see and what did I read? What was I passionate about?
I was passionate about the American dream — the opportunity for everyone to be successful, to make it in life through their own personal effort.
I, like many other teenagers, was passionate about a certain brand of jeans that were not available in the GDR and which my aunt in West Germany regularly sent to me.
I was passionate about the vast American landscape which seemed to breathe the very spirit of freedom and independence. Immediately in 1990 my husband and I traveled for the first time in our lives to America, to California. We will never forget our first glimpse of the Pacific Ocean. It was simply gorgeous.
I was passionate about all of these things and much more, even though until 1989 America was simply out of reach for me. And then, on November 9, 1989, the Berlin Wall came down. The border that for decades had divided a nation into two worlds was now open.
And that is why for me today is, first of all, the time to say thank you.
I thank the American and Allied pilots who heard and heeded the desperate call of Berlin’s mayor Ernst Reuter as he said “People of the world, … look upon this city.”
For months, these pilots delivered food by airlift and saved Berlin from starvation. Many of these soldiers risked their lives doing this. Dozens lost their lives. We will remember and honor them forever.
I thank the 16 million Americans who have been stationed in Germany over the past decades. Without their support as soldiers, diplomats and generally as facilitators it never would have been possible to overcome the division of Europe. We are happy to have American soldiers in Germany, today and in the future. They are ambassadors of their country in our country, just as many Americans with German roots today act as ambassadors of my country here.
I think of John F. Kennedy, who won the hearts of despairing Berliners during his 1963 visit after the construction of the Berlin Wall when he called out to them: “Ich bin ein Berliner.”
Ronald Reagan far earlier than others saw and recognized the sign of the times when, standing before the Brandenburg Gate in 1987, he demanded: “Mr. Gorbachev, open this gate … Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall.” This appeal is something that will never be forgotten.
I thank George Herbert Walker Bush for placing his trust in Germany and then Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl and presenting us Germans with an offer of immeasurable value in May 1989: “Partnership in leadership.” What a generous offer, 40 years after the end of World War II. Just last Saturday we saw each other again in Berlin, along with Mikhail Gorbachev. We also owe him a debt of gratitude.
Ladies and gentlemen, to sum it up in one sentence: I know, we Germans know, how much we owe to you, our American friends. We as a nation, and I personally, will never forget that.
All over Europe the common quest for freedom released an incredible power: in the trade union Solidarno in Poland, amongst the reformers surrounding Václav Havel in Czechoslovakia, at the first opening of the Iron Curtain in Hungary and at the demonstrations that took place every Monday in the GDR.
Where there was once only a dark wall, a door suddenly opened and we all walked through it: onto the streets, into the churches, across the borders. Everyone was given the chance to build something new, to make a difference, to venture a new beginning.
I also started anew. I left my job as a physicist at the Academy of Sciences in East Berlin behind me and went into politics. Because I finally had the chance to make a difference. Because I had the impression that now it was possible to change things. It was possible for me to do something.
Ladies and gentlemen, twenty years have passed since we were given this incredible gift of freedom. But there is still nothing that inspires me more, nothing that spurns me on more, nothing that fills me more with positive feelings than the power of freedom.
A person who has experienced such a positive surprise in life believes that much is possible. Or, to put it in the words of Bill Clinton in Berlin in 1994: “Nothing will stop us. All things are possible.”
Yes, all things are possible. Like the fact that a woman like me can stand before you today. That a man like Arnold Vaatz, who spent time in prison because he was a dissident during the GDR regime in Dresden, can be here today as a Member of the German Bundestag and of my delegation.
All things are possible, also in the 21st century, in the age of globalization. We back home in Germany know just as well as you do in America that many people are afraid of globalization. We do not just brush these concerns aside. We recognize the difficulties. And yet it is our duty to convince people that globalization is an immense global opportunity, for each and every continent, because it forces us to act together with others. The alternative to globalization would be shutting ourselves off from others, but this is not a viable alternative. It would lead only to isolation and therefore misery. Thinking in terms of alliances and partnerships on the other hand, is what will take us into a good future.
Ladies and gentlemen, it is true that America and Europe have had their share of disagreements. One may feel the other is sometimes too hesitant and fearful, or from the opposite perspective, too headstrong and pushy. And nevertheless, I am deeply convinced that there is no better partner for Europe than America and no better partner for America than Europe.
Because what brings Europeans and Americans together and keeps them together is not just a shared history. What brings and keeps Europeans and Americans together are not just shared interests and the common global challenges that all regions of the world face. That alone would not be sufficient to explain the very special partnership between Europe and America and make it last. It is more than that. That which brings Europeans and Americans closer together and keeps them close is a common basis of shared values. It is a common idea of the individual and his inviolable dignity. It is a common understanding of freedom in responsibility. This is what we stand for in the unique transatlantic partnership and in the community of shared values that is NATO. This is what fills “Partnership in Leadership” with life, ladies and gentlemen.
This basis of values was what ended the Cold War, and it is this basis of values that will enable us to stand the tests of our times- and these tests we must stand.
Germany is united, Europe is united. That is what we have achieved. Now, today, our political generation must prove that it is able to meet the challenges of the 21st century, and that in a sense it is able to tear down today’s walls.
What does that mean? First it means building peace and security, second, achieving prosperity and justice, and third, protecting our planet. Here, too, America and Europe are called upon in a very special way.
Even after the end of the Cold War we are thus faced with the task of tearing down the walls between different concepts of life, in other words the walls in people’s minds that make it difficult time and again to understand one another in this world of ours. This is why the ability to show tolerance is so important. While, for us, our way of life is the best possible way, others do not necessarily feel that way. There are different ways to create peaceful coexistence. Tolerance means showing respect for other people’s history, traditions, religion and cultural identity.
But let there be no misunderstanding: Tolerance does not mean “anything goes.” There must be zero tolerance towards all those who show no respect for the inalienable rights of the individual and who violate human rights. Zero tolerance must also be shown if, for example, weapons of mass destruction fall into the hands of Iran and possibly threaten our security!
Iran must be aware of this. Iran knows our offer, but Iran also knows where we draw the line: A nuclear bomb in the hands of an Iranian President who denies the Holocaust, threatens Israel and denies Israel the right to exist, is not acceptable!
For me, Israel’s security will never be open to negotiation. Not only Israel is threatened but the entire free world. Whoever threatens Israel also threatens us! This is why the free world meets this threat headon, if necessary with tough economic sanctions. Ladies and gentlemen, Germany will therefore provide staunch support to the peace process with the aim of realizing a twostate solution, a Jewish State of Israel and a Palestinian state.
We also stand up to the threat of international terrorism. We are aware that no country, no matter how strong, can do this alone. We all need partners. We are only strong if we are part of a community of partners.
Since we shared the view of the then President George W. Bush, after 9/11, that we had to do everything we could to prevent Afghanistan from ever again harboring a threat to security, Germany has since 2002 been present on the ground with the third-largest troop contingent. We want to make the concept of networked security successful. This means that civilian and military engagement are inextricably linked.
The international community’s commitment in Afghanistan is undoubtedly a tough one. It places great demands on all of us, and it must be taken into the next phase as soon as the new Afghan government is in office. Our objective must be to develop a strategy to transfer responsibility, which we want to do early next year at a joint UN conference. We will be successful if, as we have done up to now, we continue travel this road together in the Alliance, every step of the way. Germany is ready to shoulder that responsibility.
There is no doubt that NATO is and will continue to be the crucial corner-stone of our collective defense. Its Security Concept is being constantly developed and adapted to new challenges. Its foundation and clear compass for peace and freedom will, however, remain unchanged.
It is my firm belief that we Europeans can contribute even more in the future. For we Europeans are currently working towards giving our European Union a new contractual basis. The final signature has just been added. This will make the EU stronger and more capable of action, and thus make it a strong and reliable partner for the United States.
On this basis we can build stable partnerships with others, first and foremost with Russia, China and India. This is because our world is freer and more networked than ever. The fall of the Berlin Wall, the revolution in information and communication technology, the rise of China, India and other countries to become dynamic economies – all this has made the 21st century world a different place from the world we knew in the 20th century. That’s a good thing, because freedom is the very essence of our economy and society. Without freedom the human mind is prevented from unleashing its creative force.
But what is also clear is that this freedom does not stand alone. It is freedom in responsibility and freedom to exercise responsibility. For that reason the world needs order. The near-collapse of the international financial markets showed what happens when there is no such order.
If there is one lesson the world has learned from last year’s financial crisis, it is that there is no alternative to a global framework for a globalized economy. Without universally-binding rules for transparency and supervision there can be no greater freedom but rather we risk the abuse of freedom and thus instability. In a way this is a second wall that has to fall: A wall standing in the way of a truly global economic order, a wall of regional and exclusively national thinking.
The key to cooperation between the major industrialized countries and emerging economies lies in the G20. Here again cooperation between America and Europe is a crucial corner-stone. It is a cooperation that is not exclusive but rather inclusive.
The G20 has shown that it can take action. We need to resist the pressure of those who almost led the nations of this world into the abyss. That means no more and no less than that international economic policy must become more sustainable. This crisis was also an expression of too much short-term thinking. Millions of people all over the world might lose their jobs or even suffer poverty and starvation because of this. To achieve prosperity and justice we must do all we can to prevent such a crisis in the future.
That also means not giving in to the temptation of protectionism. This is why the WTO Doha negotiations are so important. The success of the Doha Round would send a valuable message of the openness of the world economy, particularly in the current crisis.
Equally, the Transatlantic Economic Council can also fulfill an important task. We can use it to prevent competing subsidies and give incentives to reduce trade barriers between Europe and America. I appeal to you: Let us jointly work towards a world economic order which is in the interests of both America and Europe!
Ladies and gentlemen, the fact that global challenges can only be met by comprehensive international cooperation is also shown by a third great challenge of the 21st century, by a wall, so to speak, separating the present from the future. That wall prevents us from seeing the needs of future generations, it prevents us from taking the measures urgently needed to protect the very basis of our life and climate.
We can already see where this wasteful attitude towards our future leads: In the Arctic icebergs are melting, in Africa people are becoming refugees due to environmental damage, and global sea levels are rising. I am pleased that you in your work together with President Obama attach such significance to protecting our climate. For we all know: We have no time to lose! We need an agreement at the climate conference in Copenhagen in December. We have to agree on one objective – global warming must not exceed two degrees Celsius.
To achieve this we need the readiness of all nations to assume internationally binding obligations. We cannot afford failure with regard to achieving the climate protection objectives scientists tell us are crucial. That would not only be irresponsible from an ecological point of view, but would also be technologically short-sighted, for the development of new technologies in the energy sector offers major opportunities for growth and jobs in the future.
No doubt about it – in December the world will look to us, to Europe and America. It is true that there can be no agreement without China and India accepting obligations, but I am convinced that if we in Europe and America show that we are ready to accept binding obligations, we will also be able to persuade China and India to join in. And then, in Copenhagen, we will be able to tear down the wall between the present and the future – in the interests of our children and grandchildren and of sustainable development worldwide.
Ladies and gentlemen, I am convinced that, just as we found the strength in the 20th century to tear down a wall made of barbed wire and concrete, today we have the strength to overcome the walls of the 21st century, walls in our minds, walls of short-sighted self-interest, walls between the present and the future.
Ladies and gentlemen, my confidence is inspired by a very special sound – that of the Freedom Bell in the Schöneberg Town Hall in Berlin. Since 1950 a copy of the original American Liberty Bell has hung there. A gift from American citizens, it is a symbol of the promise of freedom, a promise that has been fulfilled. On October 3, 1990 the Freedom Bell rang to mark the reunification of Germany, the greatest moment of joy for the German people. On September 13, 2001, two days after 9/11, it tolled again, to mark America’s darkest hour.
The Freedom Bell in Berlin is, like the Liberty Bell in Philadelphia, a symbol which reminds us that freedom does not come about of itself. It must be struggled for and then defended anew every day of our lives. In this endeavor Germany and Europe will also in future remain strong and dependable partners for America. That I promise you. Thank you very much.

10368,"Ali Treki, PGA Inauguration Speech",http://undocs.org/en/A/64/PV.1,Ali Treki,President of the General Assembly,Inauguration Speech,2009,,"The President (spoke in Arabic): I should like to begin by expressing my gratitude and appreciation for having been elected President of the General Assembly at its sixty-fourth session. My election is a great honour for my country and its leadership. It confers on me the considerable responsibility of doing everything I can to promote the interests, peace, prosperity and well-being of the international community. I should also like to thank Mr. Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann, President of the General Assembly at its sixty-third session, and to express my utmost consideration, appreciation, gratitude and respect for his excellent stewardship of that session. He fulfilled that vital role with courage and wisdom. I have met with members of regional groups and bilateral meetings. The trust and support they have expressed in me have given me confidence in myself and in the future of the United Nations, which is our only hope for security, peace, well-being and prosperity. The United Nations and, in particular, the General Assembly are the way to a better future. People of all colours, religions and origins must cooperate and engage in dialogue through our Organization. The world has become much smaller as a result of tremendous progress in information and communications technology. We all feel now that whatever affects some of us also affects the others, and that dialogue is the only solution. Despite that realization and that hope, we should not make light of the problems that confront us. I think everyone understands that the United Nations is in need of reform and democratization. The General Assembly, which represents the entire world, has been hampered by the obstacles in its path. It has been unable to ensure respect for or enforce its resolutions. The United Nations must be reformed and regain international legitimacy, ensuring that its voice is heard and respected and that its resolutions are implemented. The reform of the Security Council, the expansion of its membership and the achievement of equitable geographic representation are also of the utmost importance. Most of the world’s inhabitants do not enjoy democratic representation. Africa, for example, is comprised of 53 States, none of which is a permanent member of the Security Council, yet they have the same characteristics as those permanent members. The same is true of Latin America and of the smaller countries represented by the Forum of Small States, which account for over half of the world’s inhabitants. It is vital to reform the Security Council and to reinvigorate the General Assembly so that they can comprehensively fulfil their roles. Dialogue and mutual understanding are the way to resolve our problems. Embargos and blockades are fruitless; they exacerbate antagonism and rebellion, while undermining respect for the will of the international community. Their only effect is on the population. Whatever their causes, wars are a humanitarian tragedy that cannot be justified. We must put an end to wars and to their causes and consequences. Notwithstanding the work that has been done with a view to reducing the gap between rich and poor, that gap has grown steadily wider. The poor are becoming poorer and the rich are becoming richer, most often at the expense of the poor and by exploiting the resources with which they are endowed. In an unequal and disharmonious world, we cannot hope for peace and security to prevail. We have all condemned terrorism, which causes instability and endangers the international community. Yet despite our joint efforts and resolutions, terrorism continues to grow and spread. We must address its roots and take a close and serious look at its causes and contributing factors. This is equally true of terrorism carried out by individuals, groups and States; State terrorism is the harshest form of terrorism. The situation in the Middle East, which has remained unresolved for over 60 years, is another threat to the international community. Despite the resolutions of the General Assembly and Security Council, peace remains a distant prospect. Through the General Assembly, the United Nations must assume a serious new role. The numerous resolutions of the United Nations must be respected and implemented. The Palestinian people’s aspirations to independence and its right to return to its land in accordance with United Nations resolutions are two fundamental conditions for the swift realization of peace and security in that sensitive part of the world. There must be an end to settlement activities, which have been condemned by the entire international community. The removal of illegal and illegitimate settlements would help to achieve security and a just peace in accordance with the resolutions with which we must comply. Most of the world’s peoples live below the poverty line. Millions continue to die of hunger, malnutrition and disease. Such tragedies are a cause of concern to all of us. War and tension remain widespread. We cannot build or achieve progress in a world where instability and insecurity prevail. Development and security are interdependent. We are faced with many momentous issues whose resolution requires dialogue, cooperation and community spirit. The theme of the sixty-fourth session encompasses joint responsibility for development, the realization of peace and security, and dialogue among civilizations, all of which are pressing issues. The special Summit on Climate Change convened by the Secretary-General will take place over the next few days. This could be an opportunity for us to bring recommendations to the Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen, which will focus on the danger of climate change. This topic, which is the subject of international consensus, affects the future of us all. We must work together not only to attenuate the danger but to end it and protect this planet, which is our common home. Our development goals for the third millennium, for which we determined the year 2015 as the deadline, may not be easy to achieve. The General Assembly will address that issue at its sixty-fourth session with a high-level meeting in preparation for the year 2010. I look forward to our joint consultations within the framework of resolution 63/302. In this connection, the resolutions on joint action for development in Africa coincide with the announcement we made at the General Assembly. The crisis of the global economy, which has affected us all, rich and poor alike, is another cause of concern to the international community. In view of the danger posed by the crisis, the relevant resolution of the General Assembly (resolution 63/303) established a working group to follow up on the topic and promote any recommendations that could be undertaken jointly to remedy the situation. I call on all States to consider the issue and take part in the search for solutions. The goal of disarmament and non-proliferation is shared by all mankind, particularly with respect to weapons of mass destruction, which currently pose a great threat. We must shoulder our responsibilities and work not only towards non-proliferation and the elimination of nuclear weapons, but also towards the elimination of other weapons of mass destruction. I assure all members that I shall do my utmost to ensure that the General Assembly gives sustained, serious and responsible consideration to, reaches consensus on, and resolves the issues that are brought before it. I should like to commend Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for the support that he has extended to me. We will be working very closely together with a view to achieving our goals of development, stability and security. I shall also make every effort to ensure full cooperation and coordination with the Security Council in various fields; our common interests demand such coordination and consultation. I assure the General Assembly that my door will be open to everyone. In conclusion, I pray that we may achieve our aims and aspirations to well-being, progress, security and stability."
10369,"David Cameron, PM Inauguration Speech",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/may/11/david-cameron-speech-full-text,David Cameron,Prime Minister (United Kingdom),Inauguration Speech,2010,,"Her Majesty the Queen has asked me to form a new government and I have accepted.
Before I talk about that new government, let me say something about the one that has just passed.
Compared with a decade ago, this country is more open at home and more compassionate abroad and that is something we should all be grateful for and on behalf of the whole country I'd like to pay tribute to the outgoing prime minister for his long record of dedicated public service.
In terms of the future, our country has a hung parliament where no party has an overall majority and we have some deep and pressing problems - a huge deficit, deep social problems, a political system in need of reform.
For those reasons I aim to form a proper and full coalition between the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats.
I believe that is the right way to provide this country with the strong, the stable, the good and decent government that I think we need so badly.
Nick Clegg and I are both political leaders that want to put aside party differences and work hard for the common good and for the national interest.
I believe that is the best way to get the strong government that we need, decisive government that we need today.
I came into politics because I love this country. I think its best days still lie ahead and I believe deeply in public service.
And I think the service our country needs right now is to face up to our really big challenges, to confront our problems, to take difficult decisions, to lead people through those difficult decisions, so that together we can reach better times ahead.
One of the tasks that we clearly have is to rebuild trust in our political system. Yes that's about cleaning up expenses, yes that is about reforming parliament, and yes it is about making sure people are in control - and that the politicians are always their servant and never their masters.
But I believe it is also something else. It is about being honest about what government can achieve. Real change is not what government can do on its own - real change is when everyone pulls together, comes together, works together, where we all exercise our responsibilities to ourselves, to our families, to our communities and to others.
And I want to help try and build a more responsible society here in Britain. One where we don't just ask what are my entitlements, but what are my responsibilities.
One where we don't ask what am I just owed, but more what can I give.
And a guide for that society - that those that can should, and those who can't we will always help.
I want to make sure that my government always looks after the elderly, the frail the poorest in our country.
We must take everyone through with us on some of the difficult decisions we have ahead.
Above all it will be a government that is built on some clear values. Values of freedom, values of fairness, and values of responsibility.
I want us to build an economy that rewards work. I want us to build a society with stronger families and stronger communities. And I want a political system that people can trust and look up to once again.
This is going to be hard and difficult work. A coalition will throw up all sorts of challenges.
But I believe together we can provide that strong and stable government that our country needs based on those values - rebuilding family, rebuilding community, above all, rebuilding responsibility in our country.
Those are the things I care about. Those are the things that this government will now start work on doing.
Thank you very much.

10374,"Joseph Deiss, PGA Inauguration Speech",http://undocs.org/en/A/65/PV.1,Joseph Deiss,President of the General Assembly,Inauguration Speech,2010,,"The President (spoke in French): The General Assembly is the pre-eminent forum for global debate. As we meet to begin the work of the sixty-fifth session of the General Assembly, the world is slowly recovering from the economic and financial crisis. This recent setback should not, however, discourage us in our struggle against the major calamities afflicting the world. On the contrary, the international community’s response to the crisis has shown us that multilateralism is working.  Today, all populations affected by poverty or threatened by war, global warming or natural disasters have the right to expect that our discussions and our actions will relieve their suffering and their pain. All of us who comprise this General Assembly have an important instrument available to us to address the great issues of today. I am convinced of this. In fact, as the Charter tells us, the General Assembly is the preeminent forum for global debate. It must be the place for a convergence of efforts and of institutions called upon to establish and assume global governance. There is no subject of concern to man and our planet that could be irrelevant to our debates. Too often, however, public opinion sees a United Nations with a General Assembly that is powerless, a talk shop with no real impact. I hope that the sixty-fifth session that is now beginning will show that we are able to make a difference. I hope that this session will meet the great expectations placed in us. We have an obligation to deliver results. The issues to be discussed are too serious for that obligation not to be our primary motivation, pushing us to move beyond our purely national interests and truly to work for the benefit of all. In that connection, I would like to thank the President of the sixty-fourth session, His Excellency Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki, for his enlightened work at the head of our Assembly and for his personal commitment. I also commend and express my gratitude to our Secretary-General, His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon, for his tireless commitment in the service of our Organization, here in New York and around the world. The session now beginning will have a heavy agenda. We shall have to focus our energies to make progress on many issues that are crucial for humanity. Three broad areas lie before us. First, we must make sure that the Millennium Development Goals are achieved. In December 2009, the General Assembly decided to hold a High-level Plenary Meeting on the Millennium Development Goals. On Monday, many heads of State and Government are expected here in New York. This summit will certainly be one of the milestones of the United Nations year, and we do not have the right to fail. Despite the economic crisis, the Millennium Development Goals are within our reach. In particular, we must bridge the gaps in the fight against hunger, child mortality and maternal health. This is possible. Our work next week must result in a sincere commitment and a genuine plan of action to ensure that we reach the ambitious goal that the international community has set for itself. Secondly, we must reinstate the United Nations and the General Assembly at the centre of global governance. The challenges we face today have acquired a global dimension and require global solutions. Our actions must enjoy broad legitimacy and be the result of inclusive processes. We must improve the mechanisms for information, consultation and cooperation between the United Nations and other actors and tools of global governance. Reaffirming the central role of the United Nations in global governance — that is the issue that I would like to see the General Assembly explore further during the general debate. Indeed, this is the subject that I proposed as the special theme following consultations with many permanent representatives, various regional groups and the Secretary-General. We must advocate for a strong, inclusive and open United Nations. As we know, the private sector, non-governmental organizations and civil society make an essential contribution to our work. However, we must also move forward decisively with internal reforms. Reform of the Security Council remains important. We are all aware of the need for such reform. I would like us to be able to make progress on this matter, but it is for the Member States to take decisions that enjoy broad support and make a convergence of views possible. Other institutional issues at this session will be the review of the work of the Human Rights Council and the Peacebuilding Commission. Furthermore, we must continue efforts to revitalize the General Assembly. In that regard, I am counting on members to ensure that our debates begin on time and that we make the most effective use of the time available. Thirdly, we must promote sustainable development. Climate change, vulnerability to natural disasters and threats to biodiversity are only some of the environmental challenges that affect all States and require a concerted effort from all countries. Environmental issues will figure prominently on our agenda, which includes the high-level meeting on biodiversity during the week of the summit on the Millennium Development Goals. I believe that it is crucial to increase awareness of the need for economic structures that are more respectful of the environment and of future generations. In this context, the term “green economy” is frequently used. I am aware that some among us are concerned by the use of this term. The adjective and noun “green economy” have different meanings to different groups. Some fears are justified and must be taken into account. Let it be clear from the outset, however, that for me “green economy” does not mean new conditionality, but rather opportunity. It is an opportunity to ensure sustainable development for the benefit of our planet, ourselves, our children and our grandchildren. The world is changing, but the fundamental purposes and principles of the United Nations are timeless. Our efforts in the three areas that I have just mentioned — poverty eradication, governance and sustainable development — will make essential contributions towards peace and security, international cooperation and friendship between peoples. The Charter must remain our ultimate guide. Peace and security are our primary calling, and much work remains to be done. This includes all of the conflicts that still ravage our world to this day and cause distress and suffering to hundreds of thousands of men, women and children. It is international cooperation and friendship among peoples that will enable us to make progress in the areas of human rights, development, humanitarian aid, disarmament and counter-terrorism. It is international cooperation and friendship among peoples that will also enable us to make progress in the areas of health and the environment. These are the values that will allow us to establish a genuine global partnership and to move forward in all areas of crucial importance for peace and security. My vision is of a strong General Assembly, which should be the main forum for global debate. However, that will require us to learn how to listen to each other. I assure members that I will make myself available so that we can work together in harmony. My door is open. I offer my leadership so that progress can be made, but, above all, I would urge us all to overcome our selfishness and our rivalries for the benefit of humanity."
10380,"Nassir Al-Nasser[4], PGA Inauguration Speech",http://undocs.org/en/A/66/PV.1,Nassir Al-Nasser,President of the General Assembly,Inauguration Speech,2011,,"The President (spoke in Arabic): It is my great honour to address members today as President of the sixty-sixth session of the General Assembly. I would like to take this opportunity to express my deep gratitude to His Excellency Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his commitment to the Organization and his strong leadership on the complex and difficult issues faced by the United Nations. Throughout this session, I will be strongly committed to conducting my responsibilities in close cooperation with Mr. Ban Ki-moon, with whom I have a strong and productive relationship. Mr. Ban Ki-moon has taken the initiative to organize a series of very important high-level meetings over the next two weeks that will touch on many of the urgent issues of our time. I extend my best wishes for their success. I would also like to express sincere gratitude to my predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Joseph Deiss, President of the General Assembly at its sixty-fifth session, as well as to his team. Mr. Deiss has successfully moved forward important issues on the Assembly’s agenda. I intend to build on the remarkable achievements during his mandate, including his efforts to strengthen the global governance architecture. (spoke in English) We come together at a critical juncture in the history of nations. People across the globe are questioning their systems of governance — no longer afraid to ask for what they deserve — and are actively seeking change. The environment is reacting to human mistreatment, striking back with seemingly endless natural disasters, with their ensuing humanitarian crises. The world economy is facing the most serious financial crisis since the Great Depression, threatening to destabilize livelihoods and undermining our global efforts for growth and prosperity. Oppressed people, as well as those living under foreign occupation, are yearning to be free. An increasingly interdependent world is forcing us to rethink the way we do business at the United Nations. Future generations will hold us accountable for how we respond to those critical issues. The sixtysixth session of the General Assembly is therefore our opportunity to define our place in this decisive moment in history. This is our opportunity to prove that we, the international community, have the courage, wisdom and tenacity to seek creative and visionary solutions, that we have learned the lessons of the past and that, when faced with those few who choose force and brutality, we choose peace, human rights and democracy. As President of the sixty-sixth session of the General Assembly, I am deeply committed to working with every member to build bridges for a united global partnership. Strong collaboration and consensusbuilding will be essential in order to successfully move forward the Assembly’s agenda at this session. Our success will also require enhancing South-South and triangular cooperation, as well as dialogue among civilizations and engagement with all major stakeholders, so as to help ensure inclusive and sustainable solutions that are in accordance with international law. My efforts will be supported by a highly competent team led by talented Qatari diplomats, whom I have selected with care and attention, and which reflects the very diversity in the Hall. (spoke in Arabic) The agenda for the sixty-sixth session is significant and rich. Moving forward the myriad issues before us will require hard work, integrity and partnership. I have identified four main areas of focus that I believe will help frame our work during this session. The first area is the peaceful settlement of disputes. History has shown that settlements arrived at through peaceful means, including those brokered through mediation efforts, provide the most costeffective and long-lasting solution for disputes. In today’s world, the need to find peaceful resolutions to disputes has become more relevant and urgent than ever. For that reason, I have suggested the theme “The role of mediation in the settlement of disputes” for this year’s general debate. Of course, this theme has a broad and multifaceted nature. I expect Member States to touch upon different aspects of this matter based their own experiences and perspectives. In the past few years, we have seen momentum within the United Nations and in many regions with regard to mediation efforts and other tools for achieving peaceful solutions. It is my intention to actively pursue that issue during the sixty-sixth session, with a view not only to continuing previous work but also to increasing that momentum. It is my view that the General Assembly should, through its revitalization, become more engaged and empowered on mediation issues so that it can fulfil its role as the world’s pre-eminent peacemaker at this major junction in international relations.  The second key priority area this year is United Nations reform and revitalization. The Organization is built on strong foundations, but its institutions were designed in the post-Second World War era. Today, the world is much more interdependent, complex and fastpaced. Change is essential in the cycle of life. There is no shame in recognizing that, after six decades, the Organization needs reform. To remain relevant and legitimate the United Nations must adapt itself in order to meet the current global challenges. At this session, let us revitalize the work of the Assembly so that it retains the necessary political power and remains efficient, effective and representative. Supporting the Assembly in responding at an early stage to emerging situations of common concern to the international community is particularly important. To remain legitimate it is also important that there be strong political will to implement the previous resolutions and decisions of the Assembly. Let us build on previous efforts to reform the Security Council and, harnessing the collective will of the membership, let us further advance such efforts. Let us foster stronger interaction and genuine balance among the General Assembly, the SecretaryGeneral, the Security Council and the Economic and Social Council in dealing with issues of peace and security, while respecting their respective mandates established by the Charter. Let us continue to ensure interaction between the General Assembly and civil society, non-governmental organizations and the private sector. By giving the United Nations the attention that it deserves, we will ensure that it preserves its rightful place as the centre of global decision-making and as the world’s pre-eminent forum for international peace and security. That is the responsibility of Member States. That is our responsibility. I call on each member to help achieve that goal. The third priority area this session is improving disaster prevention and response. Recently, we have experienced an unprecedented surge in natural and man-made disasters. The Earth’s temperature is rising; tectonic plates are shifting; and lands are drying up. Populations across the world are experiencing increased vulnerability, food insecurity and health and education crises. To address those critical issues, we must enhance cooperation among the various actors. We must invest in preparedness and take forward our efforts to reduce the threat of and vulnerability to natural hazards. One way of achieving that goal is to focus more on building the capacities of vulnerable regions in order to make them more capable and self-reliant, not acting only in the aftermath of disasters. We must provide full moral and financial support to help restore peace and security in Somalia, where the people face starvation and a humanitarian disaster on an unimaginable scale. I will do my utmost to focus the attention of the General Assembly on that unfolding crisis. We must recognize that humanitarian issues are also development issues, and that our success in protecting against natural hazards will have a direct impact on our ability to fulfil the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). I am committed to working with each Member State to strengthen our response efforts and to become more coordinated and holistic in our approach. The fourth focus area is sustainable development and global prosperity. This area is also a key pillar of the Secretary-General’s work. This year will be vital in pushing forward the sustainable development agenda. The High-level Meeting on Desertification, to be held next week, will give momentum to the upcoming United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development (Rio+20) and the upcoming tenth session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification, to be held in the Republic of Korea. The Rio+20 meeting in June will be a unique opportunity for the international community to recommit to sustainable development, the eradication of poverty and the achievement of the MDGs. I am committed to actively participating in the Conference preparations, with a view to continuing and maintaining an open and transparent dialogue on its objectives and themes. I am fully confident that all 193 Members want Rio+20 to be forward-looking, to build on past experiences, and to reaffirm the balance among the economic, social and environmental aspects of sustainable development, with the human being at the centre of our efforts. On the issue of climate change, a key priority will be safeguarding the human rights of those whose lives are most adversely affected by the Earth’s rising temperatures. That challenge can be effectively addressed only through a partnership between developing and developed countries, based on the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities. The seventeenth session of the parties to the United Nations Climate Change Conference will be hosted this year in Durban. I would urge world leaders to take strong and urgent action for the protection of the global climate for the sake of present and future generations. I wish Member States successful and fruitful outcomes at those important meetings. This year, we will also mark the tenth anniversary of the New Partnership for Africa’s Development, a vital framework for helping to address poverty and underdevelopment throughout Africa. With the target date for the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals on the horizon, and as we face global economic turmoil, improving global governance and finding innovative financing modalities will continue to be on our agenda. As the Secretary-General has said on various occasions, the major groups should come together to solve the global financial crisis. No one can fix this issue alone. The United Nations should be the central forum for discussing the matter. (spoke in English) I hope that these four areas will provide a framework in which to focus our efforts during this session. There will be, of course, many more issues that we will have to address, including moving forward on the comprehensive convention on international terrorism and strengthening the peacebuilding architecture. During this session, the Assembly will deliberate extensively on sensitive issues related to development, human rights and global safety and security, and will review the scale of assessments for the regular budget. My Office and I will work closely with each subsidiary body to ensure that the intergovernmental process takes into account the broad spectrum of views and that it finds consensual solutions. Also during this session, I will emphasize the need to fully and effectively implement all United Nations declarations and programmes. This will be an important year for disarmament issues, in particular nuclear disarmament, which remains a prominent and ever more pressing priority for the United Nations. With a notably busy 2012 agenda of meetings on disarmament, including the United Nations Conference on the Arms Trade Treaty and the review of the Programme of Action to Prevent, Combat and Eradicate the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects, I assure the Assembly that I will consult with all interested parties and will exert all the necessary efforts so that longawaited, tangible progress is realized in that regard. On every issue before us, I pledge to find consensus, build partnerships and focus on implementation and real impact. After two decades of experience with the diplomatic corps at the United Nations, I consider members my friends and my family. I will count on their cooperation and support to move the General Assembly agenda forward. The sands are shifting. We have before us a unique opportunity to shape change and ensure that our next chapter will be safer for the most vulnerable, more prosperous for those in need and kinder to planet Earth. I am humbled by the opportunity to serve the Assembly as President and look forward to our close and successful partnership, working together for the sake of humankind."
10385,"Vuk Jeremic, PGA Inauguration Speech",http://undocs.org/en/a/67/pv.1,Vuk Jeremic,President of the General Assembly,Inauguration Speech,2012,,"The President: It is my great honour to address members at the opening of the sixty-seventh session of the General Assembly. I come from a proud, democratic country that I have been greatly privileged to serve in two successive terms as Foreign Minister. During that time, I addressed the General Assembly in the Hall on several occasions. Today, however, I do so for the first time as its President. Before this greatest of parliaments, I pledge to faithfully serve the cause of the United Nations and to exercise my authority in a forthright and even-handed manner, with the utmost respect for the sovereign equality of the Member States. At the onset of my remarks, allow me to express my deep appreciation for my predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser. I thank him and his Office for their tireless efforts in moving forward the agenda of the General Assembly and greatly increasing the visibility of this institution. I would also like to take this opportunity to voice my sincerest gratitude to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his unfaltering commitment to the Organization’s values and principles. Since taking office, he has presented a robust and visionary programme, while continuing to demonstrate strong leadership in dealing with the many complex issues that humankind faces. The two of us have had a solid and productive relationship so far, and I look forward to working even more closely with him throughout this session in my new capacity. In addition, I would like to underline the importance I attach to strengthening cooperation with the other principal organs of the United Nations, including the Security Council, as well as with the various entities and specialized agencies of the Organization. Like my predecessors, I will work with civil society representatives. With notable exceptions, however, we have not yet found an efficient way to draw upon the tremendous capacities of the world’s public policy institutes and think tanks. As President, I intend to launch a number of initiatives to harness their wisdom and experience. My main responsibility, however, will be towards the Member States. I look forward to engaging with them in furtherance of shared goals and objectives. I will count particularly on my Vice-Presidents during the work of the General Committee during this session. The General Assembly lies at the heart of the United Nations. It is the only forum where all Member States come together as sovereign equals to advance the aims of the Charter of the United Nations. Its preamble states that the Organization was established to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war, which has brought untold sorrow to mankind. The maintenance of international peace and security was enshrined by our founders as the first stated purpose of the United Nations, in order to make it possible for human beings to live in greater prosperity, under a reign of peace founded on justice and universal respect for international law. Their vision must remain at the core of the Organization. “We meet here amidst upheavals of unprecedented scope” were the words used by one of the most influential statesmen of our time, spoken a few months ago, to describe this period of our history. The resulting high level of geopolitical volatility will probably remain with us for quite some time. That will surely make it much more complicated to carry out our duties. However much it may be wished, the United Nations is not in a position to solve all of the world’s problems overnight. Yet for all its imperfections, which are, after all, inherent in any institution shaped by the human mind, I am strongly convinced that the Organization remains critical to addressing the growing needs of humankind. One simply cannot imagine a world in which peace and the dignity of all could flourish without the United Nations. Having consulted widely on the matter, I have chosen “Bringing about adjustment or settlement of international disputes or situations by peaceful means” as the overarching theme for our work over the next 12 months. It provides continuity with the work of previous sessions and builds on the priorities of the Secretary-General. I hope this framework will usefully serve the noble cause of preventing developing conflicts and resolving existing ones. Peace and security is a prerequisite for the stability needed for global economic growth, sustainable development, and social progress. As President, I will work with Member States on bringing us closer to meeting the Millennium Development Goals. In addition, we must focus on the post-2015 agenda. Our objective should be the full implementation of the mandate that this body received at the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development. That will require a decisive commitment to observe not only procedural deadlines, but also the political and financial objectives it has been designed to accomplish. That includes launching the process of identifying, and ultimately implementing, the sustainable development goals and placing the evolving sustainable development framework at the service of conflict prevention. I believe that will not only complement, but will decisively reinforce, all other efforts to strengthen international peace and security. As President, I will also work with the Member States so that the General Assembly can improve global economic governance. Each in its own way — the Group of Eight, the Group of 20 (G-20), the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and others — plays a critical role. However, I strongly believe that the chief deliberative, policymaking and representative organ of the United Nations ought to contribute more to the ongoing discourse about how to shape the material destiny of our planet. Accordingly, I intend to convene an informal high-level meeting on the issue. Its aim would be to establish, in the next few years, an effective consultative framework between the General Assembly and international financial and trade institutions, including the G-20. The General Assembly should endeavour to make progress in the fields of arms control and disarmament. As President, I will support efforts towards the achievement of a successful outcome to the 2015 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. I hope to engage with Member States on how present impasses in this critical area can be overcome, including those revolving around the Conference on Disarmament. I will also encourage Member States to sustain efforts on achieving the early entry into force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. I will also urge the Assembly to strengthen the role of United Nations peacekeeping. I would like to engage with the membership on how we can more decisively support those who serve under the United Nations flag in conflict-ridden areas throughout the world. The presence of the United Nations on the ground is an indispensable instrument of peace. For many decades, it has greatly contributed to reducing hostilities between belligerents, while helping to create an atmosphere of peace more conducive to the settlement of disputes by peaceful means. Contemporary United Nations peacekeeping is both complex and continually evolving. I would like to recognize the growing role the African Union in partnership with the United Nations is playing in conflict prevention, management and resolution across the African continent. Other important regional actors, such as the European Union, are also increasing their participation in United Nations-led missions. As President, I will encourage the expansion of such activities. When a settlement is reached anywhere in the world, I believe that the General Assembly, coming together in consensus, can act as a moral guarantor of what has been agreed. The fight against terrorism must also remain high on our agenda. On that issue, one of the most important instruments at our disposal remains the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy. I also wish to underscore my view that efforts should be increased to finalize a draft comprehensive convention on international terrorism, in accordance with resolution 66/105. By working more closely together, we will send a clear message to those who finance, plan and engage in terror that history is not on their side. We must never yield to them. All available resources to help eliminate this global scourge need to be marshalled. Come what may, terror must be defeated. Sixty-four years ago, the General Assembly adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which solemnly linked respect for the inalienable rights of individuals with advancing the cause of peace and security. I strongly believe that the United Nations should continue to play a leading role in promoting and protecting human rights in the international arena. The General Assembly, together with the Human Rights Council, ought to devote greater attention to realizing what the Declaration called a “common standard of achievement”. Highlighting urgent human rights situations is important work. In my view, that goal can be more readily advanced through a collaborative approach, not a confrontational one. During this session, the effort to strengthen and enhance the effective functioning of the human rights treaty body system should continue. I would also like to emphasize my steadfast commitment to ensuring equal rights and opportunities for women. As President, I will consult with Member States on how the General Assembly and UN-Women can work more closely together. One issue of great concern remains the trafficking of women and combating violence against them. This is a heinous form of modern-day slavery. Unfortunately, it is one of the fastest growing criminal industries, rivalling the trafficking in illicit drugs and arms. During this session, the Assembly will be presented with an important appraisal of the United Nations Global Plan of Action to Combat Trafficking in Persons, which we adopted in 2010. I will work with Member States to ensure appropriate follow-up actions take place, so that we can help bring this appalling crime to an end. On the final day of the sixty-sixth session, the General Assembly adopted its latest resolution on revitalization. As President, I will work with Member States, and with the Ad Hoc Working Group in particular, on identifying further ways to enhance the role, authority, effectiveness and efficiency of that body, with a particular focus on implementing what has already been agreed. To revitalize this most universal of multilateral institutions is to renew our faith not only in the United Nations programmes and purposes, but also in each other. Member States can count on me to assist and facilitate in advancing the revitalization agenda, including the Security Council reform process. Close to 800 years after the Magna Carta Libertatum was promulgated, many people around the world still do not enjoy the fundamental rights enshrined in that seminal document — rights that protect individuals while enabling countries to develop in peace and security as sovereign equals. That is why I believe the rule of law should remain high on the agenda of the sixty-seventh session. I urge Member States to agree on a consensus document by the beginning of the highlevel debate on the rule of law, in a few days’ time. As President, I will work closely with the General Assembly on implementing any mandate that may result from the meeting. I will also seek to harness our efforts in tackling other important issues, including the promotion of indigenous peoples’ rights and that of persons with disabilities. Ivo Andrić, our Nobel Prize in laureate in literature, once wrote, “I am not afraid of human beings, but of what is inhuman in them”. Assuaging that fear by consciously seeking to tame our most primeval impulses has been a critical task of legislators and statesmen for millenniums. Such reasoning has informed the drafting of every just law, great constitution or lasting treaty. It also stands at the foundation of the United Nations Charter, a document that aims first and foremost to obviate the recourse to war. It is my sincere hope that our deliberations, properly conducted, will serve to reinforce the proposition that the United Nations is an indispensable element of international relations. The challenges we will face over the next year will likely be great in number. As we begin the sixtyseventh session, let us never lose sight of our shared obligation to participate in the responsible stewardship of the purposes and principles of the Organization and remain dedicated to resolve our differences harmoniously through dialogue, not discordantly through confrontation. Let the tempered conduct of the best of those who came before us serve as a worthy signpost along our way. That can help enrich our perspective and, in so doing, strengthen the cause of establishing true and lasting peace in the world. Among all the leaders and statesmen ever to walk through the doors of the United Nations, few have been quite like Dag Hammarskjöld, whose life came to an abrupt end exactly 51 years ago today. As we reflect on what lies ahead during the sixtyseventh session, we might draw inspiration from what he wrote down not long before his death: “Never measure the height of a mountain until you have reached the top. Then you will see how low it was … Never look down to test the ground before taking your next step; only he who keeps his eye fixed on the far horizon will find the right road ... Never, `for the sake of peace and quiet’, deny your own experience and convictions.” I now give the floor to the Secretary-General, His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon."
10386,"Barack Obama, Presidential Inauguration Speech",https://avalon.law.yale.edu/21st_century/obama.asp,Barack Obama,President (United States),Inauguration Speech,2013,,"THE PRESIDENT:  Vice President Biden, Mr. Chief Justice,
members of the United States Congress, distinguished guests, and fellow citizens:  
 
Each time we gather to inaugurate a President we bear witness to the enduring strength of our Constitution.  We affirm the promise of our democracy.  We recall that what binds this nation together is not the colors of our skin or the tenets of our faith or the origins of our names.  What makes us exceptional -- what makes us American -- is our allegiance to an idea articulated in a declaration made more than two centuries ago:
“We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.”  
 
Today we continue a never-ending journey to bridge the meaning of those words with the realities of our time.  For history tells us that while these truths may be self-evident, they’ve never been self-executing; that while freedom is a gift from God, it must be secured by His people here on Earth.  (Applause.)  The patriots of 1776 did not fight to replace the tyranny of a king with the privileges of a few or the rule of a mob.  They gave to us a republic, a government of, and by, and for the people, entrusting each generation to keep safe our founding creed.  
 
And for more than two hundred years, we have.  
 
Through blood drawn by lash and blood drawn by sword, we learned that no union founded on the principles of liberty and equality could survive half-slave and half-free.  We made ourselves anew, and vowed to move forward together.  
 
Together, we determined that a modern economy requires railroads and highways to speed travel and commerce, schools and colleges to train our workers. 
 
Together, we discovered that a free market only thrives when there are rules to ensure competition and fair play.  
 
Together, we resolved that a great nation must care for the vulnerable, and protect its people from life’s worst hazards and misfortune. 
 
Through it all, we have never relinquished our skepticism of central authority, nor have we succumbed to the fiction that all society’s ills can be cured through government alone.  Our celebration of initiative and enterprise, our insistence on hard work and personal responsibility, these are constants in our character.
 
But we have always understood that when times change, so must we; that fidelity to our founding principles requires new responses to new challenges; that preserving our individual freedoms ultimately requires collective action.  For the American people can no more meet the demands of today’s world by acting alone than American soldiers could have met the forces of fascism or communism with muskets and militias.  No single person can train all the math and science teachers we’ll need to equip our children for the future, or build the roads and networks and research labs that will bring new jobs and businesses to our shores.  Now, more than ever, we must do these things together, as one nation and one people.  (Applause.) 
 
This generation of Americans has been tested by crises that steeled our resolve and proved our resilience.  A decade of war is now ending.  (Applause.)  An economic recovery has begun.  (Applause.)  America’s possibilities are limitless, for we possess all the qualities that this world without boundaries demands:  youth and drive; diversity and openness; an endless capacity for risk and a gift for reinvention.  My fellow Americans, we are made for this moment, and we will seize it -- so long as we seize it together.  (Applause.)  
 
For we, the people, understand that our country cannot succeed when a shrinking few do very well and a growing many barely make it.  (Applause.)  We believe that America’s prosperity must rest upon the broad shoulders of a rising middle class.  We know that America thrives when every person can find independence and pride in their work; when the wages of honest labor liberate families from the brink of hardship.  We are true to our creed when a little girl born into the bleakest poverty knows that she has the same chance to succeed as anybody else, because she is an American; she is free, and she is equal, not just in the eyes of God but also in our own.  (Applause.)   
 
We understand that outworn programs are inadequate to the needs of our time.  So we must harness new ideas and technology to remake our government, revamp our tax code, reform our schools, and empower our citizens with the skills they need to work harder, learn more, reach higher.  But while the means will change, our purpose endures:  a nation that rewards the effort and determination of every single American.  That is what this moment requires.  That is what will give real meaning to our creed.   
 
We, the people, still believe that every citizen deserves a basic measure of security and dignity.  We must make the hard choices to reduce the cost of health care and the size of our deficit.  But we reject the belief that America must choose between caring for the generation that built this country and investing in the generation that will build its future.  (Applause.)  For we remember the lessons of our past, when twilight years were spent in poverty and parents of a child with a disability had nowhere to turn. 
 
We do not believe that in this country freedom is reserved for the lucky, or happiness for the few.  We recognize that no matter how responsibly we live our lives, any one of us at any time may face a job loss, or a sudden illness, or a home swept away in a terrible storm.  The commitments we make to each other through Medicare and Medicaid and Social Security, these things do not sap our initiative, they strengthen us.  (Applause.)  They do not make us a nation of takers; they free us to take the risks that make this country great.  (Applause.)  
 
We, the people, still believe that our obligations as Americans are not just to ourselves, but to all posterity.  We will respond to the threat of climate change, knowing that the failure to do so would betray our children and future generations.  (Applause.)  Some may still deny the overwhelming judgment of science, but none can avoid the devastating impact of raging fires and crippling drought and more powerful storms.  
 
The path towards sustainable energy sources will be long and sometimes difficult.  But America cannot resist this transition, we must lead it.  We cannot cede to other nations the technology that will power new jobs and new industries, we must claim its promise.  That’s how we will maintain our economic vitality and our national treasure -- our forests and waterways, our crop lands and snow-capped peaks.  That is how we will preserve our planet, commanded to our care by God.  That’s what will lend meaning to the creed our fathers once declared.
 
We, the people, still believe that enduring security and lasting peace do not require perpetual war.  (Applause.)  Our brave men and women in uniform, tempered by the flames of battle, are unmatched in skill and courage.  (Applause.)  Our citizens, seared by the memory of those we have lost, know too well the price that is paid for liberty.  The knowledge of their sacrifice will keep us forever vigilant against those who would do us harm. But we are also heirs to those who won the peace and not just the war; who turned sworn enemies into the surest of friends -- and we must carry those lessons into this time as well.
 
We will defend our people and uphold our values through strength of arms and rule of law.  We will show the courage to try and resolve our differences with other nations peacefully –- not because we are naïve about the dangers we face, but because engagement can more durably lift suspicion and fear.  (Applause.)
 
America will remain the anchor of strong alliances in every corner of the globe.  And we will renew those institutions that extend our capacity to manage crisis abroad, for no one has a greater stake in a peaceful world than its most powerful nation.  We will support democracy from Asia to Africa, from the Americas to the Middle East, because our interests and our conscience compel us to act on behalf of those who long for freedom.  And we must be a source of hope to the poor, the sick, the marginalized, the victims of prejudice –- not out of mere charity, but because peace in our time requires the constant advance of those principles that our common creed describes:  tolerance and opportunity, human dignity and justice.  
 
We, the people, declare today that the most evident of truths –- that all of us are created equal –- is the star that guides us still; just as it guided our forebears through Seneca Falls, and Selma, and Stonewall; just as it guided all those men and women, sung and unsung, who left footprints along this great Mall, to hear a preacher say that we cannot walk alone; to hear a King proclaim that our individual freedom is inextricably bound to the freedom of every soul on Earth.  (Applause.) 
 
It is now our generation’s task to carry on what those pioneers began.  For our journey is not complete until our wives, our mothers and daughters can earn a living equal to their efforts.  (Applause.)  Our journey is not complete until our gay brothers and sisters are treated like anyone else under the law  –- (applause) -- for if we are truly created equal, then surely the love we commit to one another must be equal as well.  (Applause.)  Our journey is not complete until no citizen is forced to wait for hours to exercise the right to vote.  (Applause.)  Our journey is not complete until we find a better way to welcome the striving, hopeful immigrants who still see America as a land of opportunity -- (applause) -- until bright young students and engineers are enlisted in our workforce rather than expelled from our country.  (Applause.)   Our journey is not complete until all our children, from the streets of Detroit to the hills of Appalachia, to the quiet lanes of Newtown, know that they are cared for and cherished and always safe from harm.  
 
That is our generation’s task -- to make these words, these rights, these values of life and liberty and the pursuit of happiness real for every American.  Being true to our founding documents does not require us to agree on every contour of life. It does not mean we all define liberty in exactly the same way or follow the same precise path to happiness.  Progress does not compel us to settle centuries-long debates about the role of government for all time, but it does require us to act in our time.  (Applause.)  
 
For now decisions are upon us and we cannot afford delay.  We cannot mistake absolutism for principle, or substitute spectacle for politics, or treat name-calling as reasoned debate.  (Applause.)  We must act, knowing that our work will be imperfect.  We must act, knowing that today’s victories will be only partial and that it will be up to those who stand here in four years and 40 years and 400 years hence to advance the timeless spirit once conferred to us in a spare Philadelphia hall. 
 
My fellow Americans, the oath I have sworn before you today, like the one recited by others who serve in this Capitol, was an oath to God and country, not party or faction.  And we must faithfully execute that pledge during the duration of our service.  But the words I spoke today are not so different from the oath that is taken each time a soldier signs up for duty or an immigrant realizes her dream.  My oath is not so different from the pledge we all make to the flag that waves above and that fills our hearts with pride.  
 
They are the words of citizens and they represent our greatest hope.  You and I, as citizens, have the power to set this country’s course.  You and I, as citizens, have the obligation to shape the debates of our time -- not only with the votes we cast, but with the voices we lift in defense of our most ancient values and enduring ideals.  (Applause.)  
 
Let us, each of us, now embrace with solemn duty and awesome joy what is our lasting birthright.  With common effort and common purpose, with passion and dedication, let us answer the call of history and carry into an uncertain future that precious light of freedom.  
 
Thank you.  God bless you, and may He forever bless these United States of America.  (Applause.)  "

German Chancellery
Berlin, Germany

12:46 P.M. CEST

CHANCELLOR MERKEL:  (As interpreted.)  A very warm welcome to the President of the United States, Barack Obama.  A very warm welcome indeed to Berlin.  It’s his first visit to Berlin as President of the United States -- certainly not his first visit to Germany. 
 
We have had on numerous occasions the opportunity to talk.  We have established ties of friendship based on trust.  And I would like to thank you for this.  Our cooperation is based on ties of friendship that have lasted for many, many decades between the Federal Republic of Germany and the United States.  And this is such a very good relationship because it is based on shared values.  When the President addresses the crowd in front of the Brandenburg Gate, it will be a President who can do this in front of a gate that is open.  The President had to remind us all of the wall needed to be torn down and the wall is down.  And this is what we owe to our American partners and friends.
 
But we also see that the world is changing and changing at a very rapid pace, so new challenges come to the fore.  And we want to tackle them with resolve and we want to tackle them together.
 
What looms most prominently on our agenda here in Germany, but also in Europe and, I trust, in the United States, and could be a very valued project to these two great economies of the world, the free trade agreement.  I'm very glad that we were able to conclude the negotiations leading up to the mandate.  We will throw our effort behind this fully and squarely because we think that economies on both sides of the Atlantic will very much benefit from it.  It’s going to be a win-win situation and it also is an eloquent testimony to this globalized world where we can work better together, both politically and economically.
 
So this is why I think this is a very, very important free trade agreement.  And I say this on behalf of the federal government as a whole.
 
We talked about questions of the Internet in the context of PRISM.  We talked at great length about the new possibilities and about also the new threats that the Internet opens up to all of us.  The Internet is new territory, uncharted territory to all of us.  And it also enables our enemies.  It enables enemies of a free, liberal order, to use it, to abuse it, to bring a threat to all of us, to threaten our way of life.  And this is why we value cooperation with the United States on questions of security.
 
I also outlined, however, that although we do see the need for gathering information, there needs to be due diligence also as regards the proportionality.  Free, liberal democracies live off people having a feeling of security.  And this is why an equitable balance needs to be struck; there needs to be proportionality.  And that is something that we agreed on, to have a free exchange of views on, between our staff but also the staff of the Home Secretary in the States and also the Minister of Interior here in Germany.  And this is going to be an ongoing battle.
 
We talked about a number of foreign policy issues.  We are, both of us, engaged in Afghanistan.  A new process has been initiated there of a transition of responsibility.  This is a process that we are going to tackle together, just as we tackled the greater military challenges of the past together -- building up the security forces in Afghanistan together.  We will stand together with the United States and solve outstanding problems that are very difficult, indeed, still.   
 
We also addressed Iran.  We addressed the Middle East situation as regards the peace process in the Middle East.  I think that the initiative of Secretary Kerry offers a very good opportunity to revive, revitalize peace talks.  The region needs peace.  The partners ought to take up the offer that is on the table, because it is urgently necessary to bring about negotiations.  And we will continue also to work on Iran, on the nuclear program of Iran.  That is also something that we agreed on. 
 
We had very good talks.  We had, as usual, very open and candid talks.  So, yet again, a very warm welcome to you, Mr. President.
 
PRESIDENT OBAMA:  Well, thank you very much.  Guten tag.  It is wonderful to be back in Berlin.  I’ve always appreciated the warmth with which I’ve been greeted by the German people, and it's no different today, although I'm particularly impressed with the warmth of the weather here in Berlin. 
 
And I’m also very grateful for Chancellor Merkel’s invitation, 50 years after the visit of President Kennedy.
 
The Chancellor and I are just back from the G8 summit, just one of the latest meetings that we've had together.  During my time in the White House, I've had the privilege of working with Angela on a whole host of issues.  The last time she was at the White House I had the privilege of presenting her with the Medal of Freedom, our highest civilian honor that a President can bestow.  And that speaks to the closeness of our relationship, the strength of our alliance. 
 
I know that here in Germany, sometimes there's been talk that the Transatlantic Alliance has been -- is fading in importance; that the United States has turned its attention more towards Asia and the Pacific.  And in both conversations with Chancellor Merkel and earlier with your President, I reminded them that from our perspective, the relationship with Europe remains the cornerstone of our freedom and our security; that Europe is our partner in almost everything that we do; and that although the nature of the challenges we face have changed, the strength of our relationships, the enduring bonds based on common values and common ideals very much remains. 
 
We began today talking about economic issues, following up on the discussions that we had at the G8 summit.  Overall, Germany is our largest trading partner in the EU, so we've got a profound stake in each other’s success.  We agreed that there’s more work to do.  Not only do we have to grow, but we also have to reform our economies structurally. 
 
And when you look within Europe, obviously different countries are at different stages in that reform and restructuring process.  We're going through our own need to reform, for example, our health care system, which is much more expensive than most of the developed world and largely accounts for our deficits and our debt.  The good news is, though, that we have gone through the worst recession in years and we are poised to come back stronger if we take advantage of these opportunities. 
 
One of the opportunities that we spoke about, obviously, was the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, or T-TIP.  The U.S.-EU relationship is already the largest in the world economically.  Thirteen million Americans and Europeans have jobs that are directly supported by mutual trade and investment.  And the Chancellor and I share the conviction that if we are successful in these negotiations, we can grow economies on both sides of the Atlantic, create jobs, improve efficiency, improve productivity and our competitiveness around the world.  And by doing so, we’re also raising standards for free trade around the world that will not just benefit us but benefit everyone.
 
When it comes to our security, the United States and Germany are more than just NATO allies.  More American personnel are stationed in Germany than any other country outside of the U.S.  We are extraordinarily grateful for the hospitality of the German people.  One of the last times I was in Germany I had a chance to visit our facility where everyone who’s injured in the battlefield comes through, and to see the dedication, but also the hospitality that Germans are providing for our young men and women when they’ve been grievously injured I think is a strong symbol of how much this means to us.
 
Our men and women have been serving side-by-side in Afghanistan.  Germany is the third-largest troop-contributing nation there.  We’re both grateful for the sacrifices that our servicemen and women and their families have made in this common effort.  And because of those efforts, Afghanistan now has the opportunity to secure itself and determine its own destiny. 
 
We welcome President Karzai’s announcement yesterday that Afghan forces will soon take the lead for security across the country, which is an important milestone -- one that we established in our NATO summit.  Even as we wind down the war responsibly and NATO’s combat mission in Afghanistan comes to an end, we’re going to have to continue to invest in the shared capabilities and interoperability painstakingly built by the tremendous sacrifices of our troops.  And I appreciate Germany’s interest in making sure that even after our troops are no longer involved in combat operations that we can continue to see progress in Afghanistan. 
 
And many of you noted that yesterday there was an announcement about the Taliban opening an office for purpose of negotiations in Qatar.  I said yesterday, this is going to be a difficult process.  The parties there have been fighting for a very long time, even before 9/11, and we don’t expect that it will be easy, but we do think ultimately we’re going to need to see Afghans talking to Afghans about how they can move forward and end the cycle of violence there so that they can start actually building their country.
 
We also discussed the other challenges in the region, including Syria.  We are united to see a negotiated political settlement to that conflict.  We want to see a Syria that’s unified, democratic, and at peace.  Right now, we need to see an end to the bloodshed, and we have to make sure that chemical weapons are not used on the ground.  I thought we saw some progress at the G8 in reaffirming the need for a transitional governing process and a U.N. investigation of the potential use of chemical weapons there.
 
I thanked the Chancellor for Germany’s unwavering support of the search for peace between Israelis and Palestinians, and I briefed her on my Secretary of State, John Kerry’s efforts to find common ground there.
 
And finally, I want to thank Chancellor Merkel’s not only generous invitation but also the humbling privilege that I'll have to address the people of Berlin from Pariser Platz on the Eastern side of the Brandenburg Gate -- the other side of the wall that once stood there, the wall that President Reagan insisted be torn down.  A quarter century since then has been one of extraordinary progress.  We can witness this in the incredible vibrancy and prosperity of Berlin.  But one of the things I'll address today is the fact that given the extraordinary blessings that we enjoy as Americans and as Germans, we have an obligation to make sure that walls around the world are torn down.  And we can only accomplish that together.
 
So I'm grateful for our alliance.  I'm grateful for our friendship.  And I'm looking forward for an opportunity to answer some questions.
 
Am I starting off?
 
MR. CARNEY:  From the American press, Julie Pace of the Associated Press.
 
Q    Mr. President, I wanted to follow up on your comments about the Taliban talks.  When you announced those talks yesterday, you praised Afghan President Hamid Karzai as being courageous for being willing to take that step.  Yet, today, Karzai says that he is suspending talks with the U.S. in response to the Taliban negotiations.  How is it possible for you and President Karzai to be on such different pages about this key decision?  And is Karzai saying different things to you privately than he is publicly today? 
 
And, Chancellor Merkel, you mentioned that PRISM came up in your discussions today with President Obama.  Are you more reassured now about the scope of those programs following the discussions?  And did President Obama give you any reassurances that the programs don’t violate German privacy rights?  Thank you.
 
PRESIDENT OBAMA:  We had extensive conversations with President Karzai both before and after the Taliban opened the office in Doha.  As I think has been reported, there were some concerns about the manner in which the Taliban opened it, some of the language that they used. 
 
We had anticipated that at the outset, there were going to be some areas of friction, to put it mildly, in getting this thing off the ground.  That’s not surprising.  As I said, they’ve been fighting for a very long time.  There’s enormous mistrust.  Not only have the Taliban and the Afghan government been fighting for a long time, they’re fighting as we speak.  We’re in the middle of a war.  And Afghans are still being killed and, by the way, members of the international forces there are still being killed.  And that’s not abating as we speak. 
 
But what we also believe is that alongside the process in which we are training, equipping a Afghan government that can be responsible for its own security -- even as we go through some, frankly, difficult negotiations around what it would mean for the international community to have an ongoing training and advising presence after 2014, we still believe that you've got to have a parallel track to at least look at the prospect of some sort of political reconciliation. 
 
Whether that bears fruit, whether it actually happens, or whether, post-2014, there's going to continue to be fighting, as there was before ISAF forces got into Afghanistan, that’s a question that only the Afghans can answer.  But I think that President Karzai himself recognizes the need for political reconciliation.  The challenge is how do you get those things started while you're also at war.  And my hope is, and expectation is, is that despite those challenges, the process will proceed.
 
Chancellor Merkel, if you don’t mind, even though the question was directed at you, I think it would appropriate for me to go ahead and talk about the NSA issue, which obviously caused controversy back home, but also here in Europe.  And then, obviously, Chancellor Merkel will have her own views on this.
 
What I explained to Chancellor Merkel is, is that I came into office committed to protecting the American people, but also committed to our values and our ideals.  And one of our highest ideals is civil liberties and privacy.  And I was a critic of the previous administration for those occasions in which I felt they had violated our values, and I came in with a healthy skepticism about how our various programs were structured.  But what I have been able to do is examine and scrub how our intelligence services are operating, and I'm confident that at this point, we have struck the appropriate balance.
 
Now, let me be very specific in terms of -- and this is what I described to Chancellor Merkel -- what these programs are that have caused so much controversy. 
 
Essentially, one program allows us to take a phone number that has been discovered separately through some lead that is typical of what our intelligence services do -- but we get a phone number.  And what we try to discover is, has anybody else been called from that phone.  And we have both data that allows us to just check on phone numbers and nothing else -- no content; nobody is listening in on a conversation at that point.  It's just determining whether or not if, for example, we found a phone number in Osama bin Laden's compound after the raid, had he called anybody in New York or Berlin or anyplace else.
 
If, in fact, we discover that another call has been made, at that point, in order to listen to any phone call, we would have to then go to a judge and seek information through a process that is court-supervised.  And this entire thing has been set up under the supervision of a federal court judge.
 
When it comes to the Internet and email, as Chancellor Merkel said, we're now in an Internet age and we have to make sure that our administrative rules and our protections catch up with this new cyber world.  What I can say to everybody in Germany and everybody around the world is this applies very narrowly to leads that we have obtained on issues related to terrorism or proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. 
 
So there are a few narrow categories.  We get very specific leads.  And based on those leads, again, with court supervision and oversight, we are able then to access information. 
 
This is not a situation in which we are rifling through the ordinary emails of German citizens or American citizens or French citizens or anybody else.  This is not a situation where we simply go into the Internet and start searching any way that we want.  This is a circumscribed, narrow system directed at us being able to protect our people.  And all of it is done under the oversight of the courts.
 
And as a consequence, we’ve saved lives.  We know of at least 50 threats that have been averted because of this information not just in the United States, but, in some cases, threats here in Germany.  So lives have been saved.  And the encroachment on privacy has been strictly limited by a court-approved process to relate to these particular categories.
Having said all that, what I’ve said in the United States is what I shared with Chancellor Merkel, and that is that we do have to strike a balance and we do have to be cautious about how our governments are operating when it comes to intelligence.  And so this is a debate that I welcome. 
 
What we’re going to be doing when I get back home is trying to find ways to declassify further some of these programs without completely compromising their effectiveness, sharing that information with the public, and also our intelligence teams are directed to work very closely with our German intelligence counterparts so that they have clarity and assurance that they’re not being abused. 
 
But I think one of the things that separates us from some other governments is that we welcome these debates.  That’s what a democracy is about.  And I’m confident that we can strike this right balance, keep our people safe, but also preserve our civil liberties even in this Internet age.
 
CHANCELLOR MERKEL:  For the German people, I can only say the following.  It’s important, it’s necessary for us to debate these issues.  People have concerns, precisely concerns that there may be some kind of blanket, across-the-board gathering of information.  We talked about this.  The questions that we have not yet perhaps satisfactorily addressed we will address later on. 
 
But there needs to be a balance; there needs to be proportionality, obviously, between upholding security and safety of our people and our country -- and there are quite a lot of instances where we were getting very important information from the United States, for example, the so-called Sauerland Group.  And at the same time, obviously people want to use those new, modern means of communication and technology and do so freely.  And as we learn to live and deal responsibly with other new means of technology, we have to learn and deal responsibly with this one.
 
And I think today was an important first step in the right direction, and I think it has brought us forward.
 
Q    Madam Chancellor, Mr. President.  First, a question addressed to you, Mr. President.  There were a number of hopes in the world that were in a way shattered as regards your legislative term -- for example, closing down of Guantanamo, or scrapping the death penalty throughout the whole of the United States, in all of the States.  And now, as regards Asia, are you singling out Germany because there’s a big risk here?
 
And, Madam Chancellor, the Nobel Prize winner, Obama is waging a drone war also via Germany.  And is he allowed to do that, according to German law?  
 
THE PRESIDENT: Let me see if I understood your question properly.  The first question was related to policies back home, related to Guantanamo or the death penalty.  And then you wanted to talk about drones, or did you just want to focus on the drone question?  I just want to make sure that I’m responsive to your question.
 
CHANCELLOR MERKEL:  I guess I ought to answer on the drones.   And Guantanamo, that was a question I believe addressed to you.
 
PRESIDENT OBAMA:  Okay.  Well, it continues to be my policy that I want to close Guantanamo.  It has been more difficult than I had hoped, in part because there’s been significant resistance from Congress on this, and on some issues I need congressional authorization. 
 
But about a month ago I gave a speech in which I said that I would redouble my efforts to do so.  Because 9/11 happened, and we now have been involved in one form or another in a war for over a decade.  One war, I think, in Afghanistan was necessary.  One war I disagreed with strongly.  But in either case there are dangers if we get on a perpetual war footing. 
 
The threat of terrorism remains real, and we have to be vigilant and we have to take steps to protect ourselves, consistent with our values and consistent with international law. But we also have to guard against being so driven by fear that we are not changing the fabric of our society in ways that we don’t intend and do not want for the future.  I think closing Guantanamo is an example of us getting out of that perpetual war mentality. 
 
Some of the people at Guantanamo are dangerous.  Some of them did bad things.  But we cannot have a permanent outpost in which they’re being held even as we’re ending a war in Afghanistan that triggered some of these -- the capture of some of these detainees in the first place.
 
So I’m confident that we can continue to make progress on this front, although, you’re right, it has not been as fast as I would have liked.  One of the things you discover as a politician is that people don’t always do exactly what you want.  It’s shocking.  And then you have to keep on working at it.
 
One thing with respect to drone policy -- in that speech that I gave I also addressed that issue of the lethal targeting of identified terrorists.  This also is a source of controversy. We have constrained it tightly, and as we defeat al Qaeda, we have to, I think, very carefully examine how these technologies are used.  I can say, though, that we do not use Germany as a launching point for unmanned drones to go after counter -- as part of our counterterrorism activities.  And so I know that there have been some reports here in Germany that that might be the case.  That is not. 
 
CHANCELLOR MERKEL:  Let me complement by saying that the United States of America have bases here, they have soldiers here.  They fulfill a very important function, particularly in the fight against terrorism.  I think of Ramstein, for example -- and also supplies to soldiers, but also caring for wounded soldiers.
 
We as allies, as members of NATO, stand shoulder-to-shoulder here.  And we provide bases for activities, and our work is based, also, on shared values.  As I said, we have exchanges on values.  And I think it's good.  I think it's the right thing to do for the United States of America to be present here with military bases in Germany.  It's a normal thing within an alliance, and this is as it should be and as it will be, and continue to be. 
 
Q    Thank you.  Mr. President, on Syria, for the purposes of transparency, can you be specific about what military arms the United States will be providing to Syrian rebels and about which groups will be receiving them?  And on the same subject, President Putin appeared resolute and isolated on Syria at the G8.  How can a political process succeed in bringing peace if Russia continues to support Assad, both militarily and politically?
 
Madam Chancellor, if I may in German, the federal government has always argued along the lines that weapons, exports and deliveries of supplies would always lead to an escalation because they could land in the hands of terrorists.  Don’t you think that the situation is going to be exacerbated if America supplies it? Perhaps you would also comment on Mr. Putin.  Thank you.
 
 PRESIDENT OBAMA:   Well, first of all, Jeff, I'm very impressed with your German.  (Laughter.)  And I don’t know if you had to practice, but you sounded great.  Chancellor Merkel said you were just okay.  (Laughter.) 
 
I cannot and will not comment on specifics around our programs related to the Syrian opposition.  What I can say is that we have had a steady, consistent policy, which is, we want a Syria that is peaceful, non-sectarian, democratic, legitimate, tolerant.  And that is our overriding goal.  We want to end the bloodshed.  We want to make sure that chemical weapons are not used, and that chemical weapons do not fall into the hands of people who would be willing to use them.  And so we've had a consistent view in our desired outcome in Syria. 
 
It's also been our view that the best way to get there is through a political transition.  And we said that a year ago; we said that two years ago.  President Assad made a different decision and has brought chaos and bloodshed to his country and has been killing his own people.  And it is our view that it is not possible for him to regain legitimacy after over 100,000 people have been killed and millions have been displaced inside the country.
 
So the question now is just, as a practical matter -- and this is what I said to President Putin -- as a practical matter, if, in fact, Syria is to remain a unified country and the bloodshed is going to end, how do we do that?  The only way to do that is through some sort of political transition process.
 
And the good news out of the G8 meeting was -- is that you saw all the countries, including Russia, reaffirming the communiqué coming out of the first Geneva talks that said we need to create a transitional governing body with full powers. 
 
The second good thing that came out of the G8 discussions was that all of us, including Russia, said we have to investigate use of chemical weapons inside of Syria, and all the parties including the government of Bashar al-Assad have to cooperate with that investigation. 
 
We’re confident that, in fact, the government has used chemical weapons.  The Russians are skeptical.  We said, fine, let’s have the United Nations get in there but do a serious investigation of it -- because we don’t want anybody using chemical weapons.
 
Now, the issue for us is how can we continue to support a political opposition and a military opposition that becomes more capable, becomes more unified, that isolates extremists who have incorporated themselves into the opposition forces inside of Syria, so that if, in fact, and when we get a political transition, there’s somebody there who can take over and function in governing and lead to a better future for all Syrians. 
 
That’s a difficult process.  It’s not one that’s happening overnight.  But all the assistance that we are providing both to the political and military opposition is designed for that purpose. 
 
Some of the stories that have been out there publicly have, I think, gotten a little over-cranked in terms of the idea that somehow the United States is preparing to go all in and participate in another war.  What we want to do is end a war.  But the only way it’s going to end is if, in fact, we have the kind of transition that I described.
 
And although, you’re right, that at this point President Putin believes that what would replace Assad would be worse than Assad himself, what I think will become more and more apparent over the coming weeks and months is that without a different government you can’t bring peace and, in fact, you’re going to see sectarian divisions get worse and worse, and start spilling over into the other parts of the region, and that would be good for nobody.
 
CHANCELLOR MERKEL:  On the issue of arms supplies, Germany has very clear, strict rules on this, legal rules, according to which we are not allowed to supply arms into areas where there is civil strife.  And that is not specifically designed for the Syrian question; it is a general rule. 
 
But that does not mean that we do not wish, and can play, a constructive role as regards the political processes -- for example, as regards humanitarian assistance; as regards also the debate on which is the right way to go about this.  How can we strengthen the opposition, those forces that work in the best interest of the people in Syria, on the ground?  And the situation is somewhat vague as regards the members of the opposition and quite different. 
 
It is our task also, as we see it, that those who wish for a good future for Syria who are not linked with terrorists get a chance to achieve full legitimacy -- because Germany, too, is of the opinion that Assad has certainly lost that legitimacy.
 
The Russian President, as I understand him, says not so clearly what I said just now, that the Syrian President namely has lost his legitimacy.  But we have found common language in the sense that we wish to work for a transition government.  And the question also has to be asked, what is going to come after that? And that is a question we need to address, and we did so.  And in the language of the communiqué of the G8 it says, we, all of us, reject terrorist forces in Syria because they would, again, exacerbate the suffering of the people there.
 
Now we have to see to it that, step by step, all of these different strands are brought together because, unfortunately, as yet, there is no common U.N. position because Russia so far was not on the side of the others.  But we must leave no stone unturned in trying, as we did during the G8, to find a common basis on which we can also speak with Russia. 
 
And there are certain areas where we obviously differ, but our political responsibility is to, time and again, seek to bring this matter forward in the right direction.  And since the situation -- if we look to Jordan, if we look to other countries in the vicinity -- becomes more and more unstable, what with the flow of refugees and all, I think it’s worth every effort to try, all of us to try to do something, based on the language of the communiqué of yesterday, to do something in the interest of the people in Syria.
 
Q    Mr. President, in the past, there were some different points of view about the best way out of the global financial crisis.  Chancellor Merkel stands for a policy of cutting back budgets to reach that of financial stability throughout the eurozone to win back trust of the markets.  Did you talk about this issue?  And what’s your position on that? 
 
And, Madam Chancellor, same question addressed to you -- has there been a discussion on the eurozone, and do you wish to abide by the policy, in view of the problems that the countries in the south have?
 
CHANCELLOR MERKEL:  Maybe I will just start with something because your question insinuates something that we don’t want.  We want prosperity.  We want competitiveness.  We want economic strength in order to bring about reduction of unemployment.
 
We talked about this at some length.  And I also said Germany in the long run will only be able to live well if Europe as a whole is doing well.  So it would be a very wrong tack for our policy to take if we were pursuing a kind of policy where we weaken those countries into which we, after all, wish to export our goods.  I think the world is changing, however, and Europe is not competitive enough in all areas.  And budget consolidation is one piece of the mosaic.  Structural reforms have to come into this. 
 
And the Italian Prime Minister addressed this issue at some length during the G8.  What does this mean for young people?  What does it mean for jobs for young people?
 
But still the task is, if 90 percent of growth globally is generated outside of Europe, than we need to produce goods that are so competitive -- as competitive for other markets to actually buy them.  And this is something that we need to undergo.  We need to draw down red tape, bureaucracy.  We need to be more open for research and development.  We need to have structural reforms.  We need to have, for example, affordable energy.  If I look at the energy price development in the United States, all of this needs to be done.  And part and parcel with that also is, particularly in a continent that is growing ever older, that we are able to reduce our budget deficits so that we don’t leave at the expense of future generations. 
 
That is what this is all about.  This is what I am fervently asking for and working for.  Europe can only help that is strong. And so a future without Europe is something that I cannot envisage for Germany.  It's two sides of one and the same coin.  On the one hand, Germany needs and wants to be competitive, and we also want others to be competitive and improve their competiveness.  And we all belong together.  This is why we showed solidarity time again, and this is, too, something that we addressed. 
 
 PRESIDENT OBAMA:   Well, as Angela said, all of us want the same thing.  We want to have an economy that is growing, where people, if they're willing to work hard, are able to succeed, and can find jobs that pay a living wage, and can retire with some dignity, and can send their children to good schools, and have health care that is affordable.  And we have to do all those things in a way that’s fiscally prudent so that we're not mortgaging our future or burdening our children and our grandchildren.
 
And I think all developing countries -- or all more developed countries have been going through some of the same challenges.  And we just went through the worst recession in many years.
 
The good news is, is that we've seen some progress.  In the United States, we fixed our banks, which was the source initially, the trigger for some of these major problems.  So we have a much stronger banking system now, with much tighter supervision.  The housing market has begun to recover.  We've now grown for close to four years -- three and a half years -- and we’ve created 7 million new jobs.
 
But we still have some reforms that we have to do.  We've got to improve the skills of our workforce.  We've got to improve our infrastructure.  We have to continue to invest in research and development.  In all countries around the world, you're seeing growing inequality, and so we have to find ways to make sure that ladders of opportunity exist for those at the bottom, and that profits and increased productivity all does not just benefit those at the top. 
 
And so what's true in the United States is also true in Europe.  Europe has different sets of problems.  Part of the challenge of the eurozone is that you have countries at different stages and levels of productivity and are further or less far along on this path of restructuring and reform. 
 
So we’ve been discussing this -- this has been a four-year conversation that we’ve been having, and I don’t think there’s a perfect recipe.  All of us have to make sure that our budgets are not out of control.  All of us have to undergo structural reforms to adapt to a new and highly competitive economy.  What’s true is, though, all of us also have to focus on growth, and we have to make sure that in pursuit of our longer-term policies, whether it’s fiscal consolidation or reforms of our overly rigid labor markets, or pension reforms, that we don’t lose sight of our main goal, which is to make lives of people better. 
 
And if, for example, we start seeing youth unemployment go too high, then at some point we’ve got to modulate our approach to ensure that we don’t just lose a generation who may never recover in terms of their careers.  And that’s the struggle that I think all of us are going through.  That’s the discussion we had at the G8.  That’s a discussion that Angela and I had here today. 
 
I’m confident that Germany will succeed in this process.  I’m confident that Chancellor Merkel cares about maintaining the eurozone and the European project.  And she, I think, is confident that the United States wants to do everything we can to get Europe through this difficult patch so that it can be a force for growth and prosperity well into the future. 
 
Thank you very much, everybody.
 
CHANCELLOR MERKEL:  Danke schön.
 
PRESIDENT OBAMA:  Danke schön."
10390,"John William Ashe, PGA Inauguration Speech",http://undocs.org/en/A/68/PV.1,John William Ashe,President of the General Assembly,Inauguration Speech,2013,,"The President: Three months ago, I stood in this Hall and expressed my gratitude to members for electing me by acclamation as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-eighth session. Today, I am once again deeply gratified and humbled as I address members for the first time in the singular capacity of President of the General Assembly at this sixty-eighth session. In so doing, I am deeply aware that I am indeed fortunate to have had the distinct pleasure of working with many members as colleagues and friends over a number of years — probably far too many years for us all to recall, assuming that we would want to. It is those years of friendship and good will that give me confidence that I can draw upon our shared sense of past collaboration and partnership to forge a new working relationship, which I hope and fervently believe will lead to a successful conclusion of this session. At the outset, let me thank my predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Vuk Jeremić, who presided over the Assembly during its just concluded sixty-seventhe session, for his valuable contributions to its work. Let me also commend our Secretary-General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, for the tremendous diligence and commitment he has shown in leading the Organization, and I look forward to working closely with him and his team in ensuring that the General Assembly remains the pre-eminent deliberative body of the United Nations. Because the United Nations is a family of agencies spread throughout the world, let me also recognize the staff of the United Nations and its various agencies for their consummate professionalism and hard work on behalf of so many across our globe. In the months since my election, I have met with nearly all representatives, either individually or through their regional groupings, to discuss my priorities for the sixty-eighth session of the General Assembly. Those discussions have been both informative and constructive, and they have afforded me the opportunity to hear members’ views, priorities and concerns on the Assembly’s agenda for the sixty-eighth session. In return, I have had an opportunity to exchange ideas on my theme for the sixty-eighth session, namely: “The post-2015 development agenda: setting the stage”. Many representatives shared positive feedback and specific thoughts about how to enhance the theme and the six events I will be holding, and for this I thank them. Members’ almost universal pledges of cooperation were very encouraging and should make the collective task of tackling the bolder aspects of our work all the more feasible. Dare I hope that this also means a new sense of urgency and an end to protraction and delay in the negotiations and work of this body, so that we can complete the ambitious agenda of our General Assembly in a timely and effective manner? I, for one, hope so. Many members are now involved in a number of intergovernmental processes that will ultimately feed into the post-2015 development agenda, so they are well aware of the challenges that lie ahead. The upcoming year will prove pivotal for the Assembly as we seek to identify the parameters of the post-2015 development agenda. The magnitude of the task before us will require decisive action and the highest levels of collaboration, and we must prove ourselves and our efforts to be equal to the enormous scope of the task. To assist members in setting the stage for the aforementioned agenda, it is my intent to convene an equal number — three in each case — of high-level events and thematic debates. There will be a high-level event to discuss the role of women, youth and civil society in the post2015 development agenda. We simply cannot reach our development goals or advance human well-being without addressing the needs and challenges of women and youth, while also making use of the contributions of both. As we reminded ourselves at the recent United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development in Rio, Governments cannot go it alone in the implementation of any development agenda, so let us therefore explore where and how we can partner more actively with civil society in this regard. Another high-level event will explore the contributions of human rights and the rule of law in the post-2015 development agenda, particularly looking at the appropriate framework to ensure that human rights, the rule of law and good governance practices anchor evolving policy platforms in a manner that empowers people to contribute to sustainable development. The third high-level event will look at the contributions of South-South and triangular cooperation and information and communication technologies (ICT) for development in the post-2015 development agenda. Over the past two decades, dramatic global change and national and regional transformations have led to unprecedented and increasingly complex socioeconomic and environmental threats, challenges and concerns. Responding to these new threats and existing challenges will require new forms of collaboration, innovation and partnership, which, in turn, will maximize the potential for ICT to contribute to reaching our development goals. The concept of partnerships is becoming increasingly important in discussions on the future of development, and rightly so. The Secretary-General has placed renewed emphasis on this area, which is embedded in the eighth and much overlooked Millennium Development Goal (MDG). Technology, capacity-building and knowledge transfer, financing and innovative means of implementation will be critical parts of the coming debate. The new development agenda will require collaboration among all actors, based on mutual trust and respect. Accordingly, one of the three thematic debates will focus on the role of partnership and its contribution to the post-2015 development agenda. Another thematic debate will examine how to work towards and ensure stable and peaceful societies in the post-2015 development framework, including by creating an enabling environment for development and progress, diminishing external stressors that contribute to conflicts, ensuring accessible institutions of justice, reducing violence and enhancing the capacity and accountability of good governance mechanisms and practices that benefit peace and sustainable development. The third thematic debate will focus on the roles of water, sanitation and sustainable energy in the post-2015 development agenda. With some 1.4 billion people without reliable electricity, 900 million lacking access to clean water and 2.6 billion without adequate sanitation, action is urgently needed to address those persistent challenges. With so many initiatives in those fields, let us try to draw upon and share the existing knowledge while scaling up the initiatives that have already worked in the areas of integrated water management, sustainable energy and sanitation services for the proposed post-2015 development agenda. While I have focused my remarks today on my selected theme, the sixty-eighth session will certainly include a range of other critical issues. A handful of these, such as migration, nuclear disarmament, the MDGs and disabilities will be discussed in the upcoming 10 days. During the session, we will also hold a high-level thematic debate, mandated by the General Assembly, focused on investment in Africa and its role in achieving development objectives. I am committed to working with all members throughout the sixty-eighth session, providing any assistance that may be required, so that, ultimately, we can set the stage for the strongest possible global development agenda, one that fully respects all people on this, our shared planet. As I laid out in my acceptance speech, I intend to dedicate significant time and resources to the issues of reforming and revitalizing the main bodies of this institution: the General Assembly and the Security Council. We are all in agreement that reform of these bodies is needed and that it is simply unacceptable to do nothing, since that would pose a major hindrance to the Organization’s realizing its full potential and would do an immense disservice to the peoples of the world, who rely on us and look to us with a sense of hope and possibility. To that end, in keeping with the Assembly’s decision to roll over this issue from the sixty-seventh to the sixty-eighth session, I will reconvene the Working Group on Security Council reform in mid-October. I look forward, over the course of the next 12 months, to the active engagement and cooperation of members on the entire agenda of the Assembly. I call on all present to join me in making this a productive and meaningful session, one in which we work in solidarity and collegial respect towards the vision of the Organization as laid out in the Charter and toward solutions to the problems that confront us all. Together we can make this a watershed year in the history of the Organization by building a new and meaningful development agenda that both protects our planet and creates equity, justice and prosperity for people the whole world over. I now give the floor to the Secretary-General, His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon."
10396,"Sam Kutesa, PGA Inauguration Speech",http://undocs.org/en/a/69/PV.1,Sam Kutesa,President of the General Assembly,Inauguration Speech,2014,,"The President: Today I am pleased to address the General Assembly for the first time as President of the Assembly at its sixty-ninth session. I am deeply humbled and honoured by the trust Member States have bestowed upon me and my country, Uganda. I am convinced that together we, as Member States, will achieve a lot over the next 12 months in advancing the core values and principles of the United Nations for the betterment of the world and its peoples. I would like to extend my heartfelt thanks to my predecessor, His Excellency Mr. John Ashe, who presided over the just-concluded sixty-eighth session of the Assembly. Mr. Ashe worked tirelessly to promote the work of the General Assembly. On behalf of all Member States, I convey our gratitude to him for his dedicated service. I wish in particular to thank him for setting the stage with the conclusion of intergovernmental processes, whose outcomes will provide key inputs for our work at this session. He also handed over to me a compendium with major activities undertaken in the past year, as a foundation on which to build in order to address outstanding issues. I also thank the Secretary-General, His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon, for his leadership, dedication and personal commitment to advancing the agenda of the Organization. I look forward to working closely with him, his team and the United Nations system as a whole. The coming year will be a momentous time for the United Nations. We will commemorate the seventieth anniversary of its founding, the twentieth anniversary of the groundbreaking Fourth World Conference on Women, 15 years since the adoption of the Millennium Declaration (resolution 55/2) and 10 years since the 2005 World Summit. It is evident that the sixty-ninth session will be very busy. In addition to dealing with the normal work of the Main Committees, we will be preoccupied with negotiations on the post-2015 development agenda. The key inputs will be the outcomes of the Open Working Group on Sustainable Development Goals, the Intergovernmental Committee of Experts on Sustainable Development Financing, the recommendations from the Structured Dialogues on a Technology Facilitation Mechanism, as well as the forthcoming Secretary-General’s synthesis report. We also have preparations for and negotiations on the outcome for the third International Conference on Financing for Development, which will be held in July 2015 in Addis Ababa, and the climate change negotiations under the auspices of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. While we have a lot of hard work ahead of us, we also have a historic opportunity to formulate a post-2015 development agenda that is transformative, brings about tangible benefits, leads to improved livelihoods for all and contributes to achieving sustainable development in its social, economic and environmental dimensions. It will also be our responsibility to ensure that adequate means are mobilized for implementing the agenda in terms of financing, technology development and transfer and capacity-building. That will require a strengthened global partnership for development and enhanced cooperation between and among Member States, the private sector, civil society and all other stakeholders. It will also require a fair trading regime and the promotion of domestic and foreign direct investment. It is for that reason that I chose the theme for the general debate at the sixty-ninth session to be “Delivering on and implementing a transformative post2015 development agenda”. As I address representatives today in this newly opened, magnificent Assembly Hall, I cannot help but think that we are here at the dawn of a new day. Let us approach the pivotal sixtyninth session with a sense of urgency, hope and greater cooperation. Let us seize the moment with a firm belief that a better tomorrow is within our reach. The General Assembly remains the pre-eminent forum for global debate and cooperation among Member States. Let us use this unique environment as intended — to harness opportunities and to find solutions to the challenges confronting humankind. We can collectively make a significant contribution this year towards changing the world we live in for the better, not only for ourselves but for generations to come. As I emphasized in my acceptance speech (see A/68/PV.93) in June, we must strive to ensure that the post-2015 development agenda is truly transformative, with the eradication of poverty and hunger and the promotion of sustained and inclusive economic growth as its overarching objectives. As we agreed in the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development outcome document (resolution 66/288), entitled “The future we want”, it should be holistic, action-oriented and universally acceptable, while also paying due attention to regional and national realities. To that end, it is my intention to convene three high-level thematic debates and one high-level event. The main objective of the debates and event is to provide an opportunity for Member States and all the relevant stakeholders to have in-depth deliberations on the selected topics, in an interactive and participatory manner, with a view to making contributions to the process of formulating the post-2015 development agenda. I wish to stress that the debates and events will not pre-empt or prejudge the outcome of the intergovernmental negotiations. The first high-level thematic debate, to be scheduled in February 2015, will be on the means of implementation for the post-2015 development agenda. Achieving sustainable development will require the mobilization and effective use of finances and technology development and transfer, as well as capacity-building. It will entail increased investments in social sectors, infrastructure, rural development, climate financing and the protection of global commons, to name but a few areas. The debate will focus on how to mobilize the significant resources that will be needed to turn the aspirations of the post-2015 development agenda into reality. The second high-level thematic debate, to be held in March 2015, will focus on advancing gender equality and the empowerment of women in the post-2015 development agenda. As highlighted in the outcome document of the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development (resolution 66/288), although progress on gender equality has been made in some areas, the potential of women to engage in, contribute to and benefit from sustainable development has not yet been fully realized. In that connection, the debate will provide an opportunity to focus on measures that must be taken to advance gender equality and women’s economic and political empowerment at all levels, as well as the importance of education in those endeavours. The third high-level thematic debate, to be held in April or May 2015, will address the peaceful settlement of disputes and the strengthening of cooperation between the United Nations and regional and subregional organizations. Over time, we have seen numerous examples of successful cooperation between the United Nations and regional and subregional organizations, particularly across my home continent, Africa. As I have stated before, such cooperation has yet to reach its full potential and must be substantially strengthened. I also intend to convene, in June 2015, a high-level event on combating climate change, which is one of the defining global challenges of our time. To preserve planet Earth for ourselves and succeeding generations, the international community has an obligation to address the effects of climate change, which threaten humankind’s very existence. It is important that, at this session, we give momentum and added impetus to efforts to reach a global agreement in 2015 under the auspices of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. In due course, I will provide details, including the specific dates and format, as well as the background and concept notes on each of the high-level thematic debates and events. One of the priorities that I highlighted for this session is the continuing focus on the revitalization of the General Assembly and the reform of the Security Council. While some progress towards making the General Assembly more effective and efficient has been made, we need to do more. In that regard, I have requested the respective Chairpersons of the Committees to pay greater attention to that matter. The need to reform the Security Council is urgent, as reflected in the 2005 World Summit Outcome (resolution 60/1). We need to find a way of making progress on the intergovernmental negotiation process, and I call upon Member States to redouble their efforts at this session. As we open the sixty-ninth session, the international community faces an unprecedented array of weighty challenges. The list is as lengthy as it is daunting. It includes poverty and hunger, persistent unemployment, violent armed conflicts, faltering education systems, climate change and rising sea levels, and inadequate infrastructure, to mention a few. In recent months, we have seen health systems overwhelmed in the face of new and dire threats, such as the Ebola virus, while new challenges to peace and security have emerged with alarming frequency, including a rise in polarization, extremism and terrorist activities.
To say that we are living in tumultuous times would seem an understatement. Yet, while the outlook may seem grim and the challenges daunting, we must not allow ourselves to be gripped by fear or despair. Together, with dedication, single-mindedness of purpose and compromise, we can achieve great things. As Martin Luther King, Jr., once said, “Everything that is done in the world is done by hope.” Let us take our hope and, as inspiration, our belief in a better future and tackle such formidable challenges with a sense of resolve and resilience over the next 12 months. Now more than ever before, the world needs harmony, unity, optimism and hope and all our nations and peoples united in peace and prosperity. I now give the floor to the Secretary-General, His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon.

10399,"Mogens Lykketoft, PGA Inauguration Speech",http://undocs.org/en/A/70/PV.1,Mogens Lykketoft,President of the General Assembly,Inauguration Speech,2015,,"The President: It is my great honour to open this, the seventieth session of the General Assembly of the United Nations, a session that I hope will be truly historic, a session not just of ground-breaking decisions, but one of much-needed concerted action for people and planet. Let me begin by once again thanking the Member States for entrusting me to lead the world’s most representative multilateral body. I also see their endorsement of me as an endorsement of the role that Denmark has played at the United Nations over the past 70 years. I will do my utmost to represent each country in a fair and open manner. As I do so, I will try to build upon the solid foundations laid by my predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Sam Kutesa. I congratulate him in particular on shepherding the post-2015 negotiations to a successful conclusion, well in advance of the United Nations summit for the adoption of the post-2015 development agenda. I thank him and his Office for their close cooperation and support in recent months. Let me also take this opportunity to recognize the crucial role played by the Secretary-General, His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon, in his tenure thus far, not least in supporting the emergence of a truly ambitious 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. I very much look forward to working closely and in a collaborative manner with him over the coming year. In less than 10 days’ time, our leaders will gather in the General Assembly Hall to adopt the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, a seminal — in fact, revolutionary, universal agreement befitting this anniversary year — and a welcome gift to a world beset by war and humanitarian crises, sectarianism and violent extremism, by poverty and inequalities, by climate change and environmental degradation. In signing up to the 2030 Agenda, Governments will voluntarily commit to take action for the dignity, security, prosperity and human rights of our shared humanity; for gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls; for the sound management and fair distribution of the Earth’s finite resources’ and for the health and vitality of our planet. It raises hope of the United Nations being fit for purpose and committed to action. The challenge now, and a major priority for my presidency, is to ensure that all actors move swiftly to deliver on the promises being made. The summit, of course, will mark only the beginning. There is an urgent need for action right across the three pillars of the United Nations, and ample opportunities to do so during this session. Not long after the summit and general debate, our leaders will come together in Paris for the twentyfirst Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. An ambitious and universal climate agreement is an absolute must, and must be the first real test of the world community’s ability to deliver the necessary policy tools for sustainable development. But there will be no sustainable development without peace and security and without respect for human rights. The United Nations and its States Members have a strong obligation to work together to end the catastrophic wars and conflicts — in and around Syria, in the greater Middle East, in Africa and even in Europe. And we have to act here and now to address the huge and explosive refugee crises resulting from ongoing conflicts, and to protect the human rights of all refugees. With the conclusion of the review of the United Nations peacebuilding architecture, the release of the global study on women and peace and security, the forthcoming plan of action to prevent violent extremism, the review of the United Nations Global CounterTerrorism trategy, and the recently published report of the High-level Independent Panel on United Nations Peace Operations (A/70/95), there is significant scope to demonstrate our commitment to action across the broad range of peace and security during this session. Among other important issues, I will also preside over the high-level meeting in December on the World Summit on the Information Society. I will hold a special session of the General Assembly in the spring of 2016 on the world drug problem, as well as a high-level meeting on HIV/AIDS. And, in May, the Secretary-General will convene a world humanitarian summit — an incredibly timely and crucial initiative. In addition, we must continue our efforts to revitalize the work of the Assembly. Responding to the continued interest among many Member States in both the reform of the Security Council and in creating more transparency and openness when selecting the next Secretary-General, I will continue the work mandated by Member States on both of those issues. We must also ensure constructive negotiations relating to the United Nations budget, and I will consult widely in the coming months to ensure their timely conclusion. Finally, during this session, several events will take place to commemorate the seventieth anniversary, including a high-level event on peace and security on 1 to 2 October; another to mark the entry into force of the Charter of the United Nations, on 23 October; and an another to mark the seventieth anniversary of the first session of the General Assembly, on 11 January 2016. With such a busy schedule ahead of us, I am keenly aware of the pressure that all Missions to the United Nations will face. The three high-level thematic debates that I will hold in my capacity as President, therefore, will aim to complement ongoing activities and to take stock of each of the three pillars of the United Nations. The United Nations summit for the adoption of the post2015 development agenda and the general debate will be the starting points for these discussions, with their focus, respectively, on sustainable development and the road ahead for peace and security and for human rights. The first high-level thematic debate will be dedicated to the implementation of commitments relating to sustainable development, climate change and financing. It will take place in April. In this way I will endeavour to mobilize and catalyse individual, collective, multilateral and multi-stakeholder action to support early progress on realizing our global goals. The second high-level thematic debate will take place in May. It will focus on strengthening the role and performance of the United Nations in the area of peace and security. It will serve as a platform for an open and frank exchange of views and could span the full spectrum of threats to global security. One of the key deliverables from this debate will be to draw out synergies from the three major peace and security-related reviews now at various stages of advancement: the peace operations review, the review of peacebuilding, and the global study on women and peace and security. The third high-level thematic debate will be organized next July and will revolve around human rights. Here, the focus will be on the role of the United Nations in the field of human rights, including in relation to governance, the rule of law, gender equality and institution-building. Taking into account the unprecedented scale of global humanitarian challenges, particular focus will be placed on addressing the needs of the hundreds of millions of men, women and children affected by conflicts and disasters. It is my hope that these events can help us to identify pragmatic and action-oriented outcomes in each area. To that end, I will consider holding support meetings to explore particular issues or elements that warrant additional focus or preparation. I will conduct all activities in as transparent, inclusive and open a manner as possible. Where it is relevant, I will also engage with and involve civil-society representatives and others, such that a multi-stakeholder approach becomes a hallmark of my presidency. I will also work closely with Committee Chairs and continue the tradition of coordinating, of course, with the Secretary-General as well as the Presidents of the Economic and Social Council and the Security Council to ensure the smooth and timely conduct of business. With the cooperation of members, I am confident that we can make substantial and meaningful progress across this broad agenda. It is, in some respects, hard to believe that this great Organization has already been in existence for 70 years. For, despite its significant evolution and achievements since 1945, the United Nations has much more to learn, much more to give and much, much more to do to fulfil its mandate under the Charter and to bring about the world envisaged by the 2030 Agenda. Let us be clear: we are here, the Assembly of the world’s nations, to help one another and the Organization to move towards that vision, through a spirit of global solidarity and with a renewed commitment to action. I now give the floor to the Secretary-General, His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon."

""In David Cameron, I follow in the footsteps of a great modern Prime Minister under David’s leadership, the government stabilised the economy, reduced the budget deficit and helped more people into work than ever before.
""But, David’s true legacy is not about the economy, but about social justice. From the introduction of same-sex marriage, to taking people on low wages out of income tax altogether, David Cameron has led a One Nation government, and it is in that spirit that I also plan to lead.
""Because, not everybody knows this, but the full title of my party is the Conservative and Unionist Party, and that word Unionist is very important to me. It means that we believe in the Union, the precious, precious bond between England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, but it means something else that is just as important.
""It means we believe in a Union, not just between the nations of the United Kingdom, but between all of our citizens, whoever we are, and wherever we’re from.
""That means fighting against the burning injustice that if you’re born poor you will die, on average, nine years earlier than others.
""If you’re black, you’re treated more harshly by the criminal justice system than if you’re white.
""If you’re a white, working class boy, you’re less likely than anybody else in Britain to go to university.

""If you suffer from mental health problems, there’s not enough help to hand.

10403,"Peter Thomson, PGA Inauguration Speech",https://undocs.org/A/70/PV.118,Peter Thomson,President of the General Assembly,Inauguration Speech,2016,,"The President: A year ago in this Hall (see A/70/PV.1), I outlined how I hoped we could galvanize a new commitment to action and instal a spirit of transparency and openness in our work. I believe that we have made considerable progress, and yet so much more needs to be done.  We kicked off the largest summit in United Nations history by adopting the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (resolution 70/1). In a world of poverty, climate change, conflict and forced displacement, with impunity for rights violations and huge gender and social inequality, the adoption of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), together with the historic Paris climate agreement, has outlined the routes for the evolutionary tranformation of our whole pattern of production and consumption. This is not only possible, but we also really have no choice in the matter. If we are to avoid future division and destruction — a crisis on a scale far greater than any known to humankind today — then the relentless and integrated implementation of the SDGs and climate action is an absolute necessity. My first high-level thematic debate focused precisely on the plans, actions, finance, technology and partnerships needed for this. We managed, after much discussion, to place the 2030 Agenda follow-up and review framework on a more solid footing. Members are now in a good position to consider how best to align the Agenda for the General Assembly in light of the SDGs. 
The Assembly also dealt with a list of important issues in relation to the SDGs. The 10-year review of the World Summit on the Information Society showed how explosive technological development presents both incredible opportunities and incredible challenges. The special session on the world drug problem saw strong support for a response rooted in human rights and in the advancement of public health. The meeting on the global battle against HIV/AIDS recommitted us to ending the AIDS epidemic by 2030. We also saw a recommitment to the implementation of support for the least-developed countries at the midterm review of the Istanbul Programme of Action in Antalya. Preparations got well under way for next years conference on how better to protect our oceans and marine biodiversity. In just over a week’s time, world leaders will address the most recent movements of refugees and migrants, in order to recommit to their international obligations and build on the achievements of the Secretary-General’s World Humanitarian Summit in Istanbul. However, it is obvious that achieving the 2030 Agenda will also demand a reverse of trends in maintaining peace and security and respect for human rights."
10404,"Donald Trump, Presidential Inauguration Speech",https://www.politico.com/story/2017/01/full-text-donald-trump-inauguration-speech-transcript-233907,Donald Trump,President (United States),Inauguration Speech,2017,,"Chief Justice Roberts, President Carter, President Clinton, President Bush, President Obama, fellow Americans, and people of the world, thank you. We the citizens of America are now joined in a great national effort to rebuild our country and restore its promise for all of our people. Together we will determine the course of America, and the world, for many, many years to come. We will face challenges. We will confront hardships, but we will get the job done.

Every four years, we gather on these steps to carry out the orderly and peaceful transfer of power, and we are grateful to President Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama for their gracious aid throughout this transition. They have been magnificent. Thank you.
Today's ceremony, however, has very special meaning, because today we are not merely transferring power from one administration to another, or from one party to another, but we are transferring power from Washington, D.C., and giving it back to you, the people.
For too long, a small group in our nation's capital has reaped the rewards of government, while the people have borne the cost. Washington flourished, but the people did not share in its wealth. Politicians prospered, but the jobs left and the factories closed. The establishment protected itself, but not the citizens of our country. Their victories have not been your victories. Their triumphs have not been your triumphs, and while they celebrated in our nation's capital, there was little to celebrate for struggling families all across our land. That all changes, starting right here and right now, because this moment is your moment --- it belongs to you. It belongs to everyone gathered here today, and everyone watching, all across America. This is your day. This is your celebration, and this, the United States of America, is your country.
What truly matters is not which party controls our government, but whether our government is controlled by the people. January 20th, 2017 will be remembered as the day the people became the rulers of this nation again. The forgotten men and women of our country, will be forgotten no longer. Everyone is listening to you now. You came by the tens of millions to become part of a historic movement, the likes of which the world has never seen before. At the center of this movement is a crucial conviction, that a nation exists to serve its citizens. Americans want great schools for their children, safe neighborhoods for their families, and good jobs for themselves. These are just and reasonable demands of righteous people and a righteous public, but for too many of our citizens a different reality exists. Mothers and children trapped in poverty in our inner cities, rusted out factories, scattered like tombstones across the across the landscape of our nation, an education system flush with cash, but which leaves our young and beautiful students deprived of all knowledge, and the crime, and the gangs, and the drugs that have stolen too many lives and robbed our country of so much unrealized potential. This American carnage stops right here and stops right now.
We are one nation and their pain is our pain. Their dreams are our dreams and their success will be our success. We share one heart, one home, and one glorious destiny. The oath of office, I take today, is an oath of allegiance to all Americans. For many decades, we've enriched foreign industry at the expense of American industry, subsidized the armies of other countries, while allowing for the very sad depletion of our military. We've defended other nation's borders while refusing to defend our own. And spent trillions and trillions of dollars overseas, while America's infrastructure has fallen into disrepair and decay. We've made other countries rich while the wealth, strength and confidence of our country has dissipated over the horizon. One by one, the factories shuddered and left our shores, with not even a thought about the millions and millions of American workers that were left behind. The wealth of our middle class has been ripped from their homes and then redistributed all across the world.
But that is the past, and now we are looking only to the future. We assembled here today our issuing a new decree to be heard in every city, in every foreign capital, and in every hall of power, from this day forward: a new vision will govern our land, from this day forward, it's going to be only America first. America first.
Every decision on trade, on taxes, on immigration, on foreign affairs will be made to benefit American workers and American families. We must protect our borders from the ravages of other countries making our products, stealing our companies and destroying our jobs. Protection will lead to great prosperity and strength. I will fight for you with every breath in my body, and I will never, ever let you down. America will start winning again, winning like never before. We will bring back our jobs. We will bring back our borders. We will bring back our wealth, and we will bring back our dreams. We will build new roads and highways and bridges and airports and tunnels, and railways, all across our wonderful nation. We will get our people off of welfare and back to work, rebuilding our country with American hands and American labor.
We will follow two simple rules: buy American, and hire American. We will seek friendship and goodwill with the nations of the world, but we do so with the understanding that it is the right of all nations to put their own interests first. We do not seek to impose our way of life on anyone, but rather to let it shine as an example. We will shine for everyone to follow. We will reinforce old alliances and form new ones, and you unite the civilized world against radical Islamic terrorism, which we will eradicate completely from the face of the Earth.

At the bedrock of our politics will be a total allegiance to the United States of America, and through our loyalty to our country, we will rediscover our loyalty to each other. When you open your heart to patriotism, there is no room for prejudice. The Bible tells us, how good and pleasant it is when God's people live together in unity. We must speak our minds openly, debate our disagreements, but always pursue solidarity. When America is united, America is totally unstoppable. There should be no fear. We are protected, and we will always be protected. We will be protected by the great men and women of our military and law enforcement. And most importantly, we will be protected by God.
Finally, we must think big and dream even bigger. In America, we understand that a nation is only living as long as it is striving. We will no longer accept politicians who are all talk and no action, constantly complaining but never doing anything about it. The time for empty talk is over. Now arrives the hour of action. Do not allow anyone to tell you that it cannot be done. No challenge can match the heart and fight and spirit of America. We will not fail. Our country will thrive and prosper again.
We stand at the birth of a new millennium, ready to unlock the mysteries of space, to free the Earth from the miseries of disease and to harness the industries and technologies of tomorrow. A new national pride will stir our souls, lift our sights and heal our divisions. It's time to remember that old wisdom our soldiers will never forget, that whether we are black, or brown, or white, we all bleed the same red blood of patriots. We all enjoy the same glorious freedoms, and we all salute the same, great American flag. And whether a child is born in the urban sprawl of Detroit or the windswept plains of Nebraska, they look up at the at the same night sky, they fill their heart with the same dreams and they are infused with the breath of life by the same almighty creator.
So to all Americans, in every city near and far, small and large, from mountain to mountain, from ocean to ocean, hear these words. You will never be ignored again. Your voice, your hopes, and your dreams will define our American destiny. And your courage and goodness and love, will forever guide us along the way. Together, we will make America strong again. We will make America wealthy again. We will make America proud again We will make America safe again, And yes, together, we will make we will make America great again. Thank you. God bless you. And god bless America. Thank you. God bless America."

10410,"Antonio Gutierres, SG Inauguration Speech",http://undocs.org/en/A/71/PV.60,Antonio Gutierres,Secretary General (United Nations),Inauguration Speech,2017,,"Mr. Guterres: I thank speakers very much for all their kind words. I am deeply honoured by the trust and confidence Member States have placed in me, and I am determined to be guided by the purposes and principles of the Charter. First of all, I would like to pay tribute to SecretaryGeneral Ban Ki-moon. His principled leadership has helped to chart the future of the United Nations, through the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, through his commitment to peace and security and through his initiative to put human rights at the heart of our work. Under his direction, the world committed to the historic Paris Agreement on Climate Change and ratified it in record time. I strongly believe that this momentum is unstoppable. It is an honour to follow in his steps, defending the same values that unite us. Twenty-one years ago, when I took the oath of office to become Prime Minister of Portugal, the world was riding a wave of optimism. The Cold War had ended and some described that as the end of history. They believed that we would live in a peaceful, stable world with economic growth and prosperity for all. But the end of the Cold War was not the end of history. On the contrary, history had simply been frozen in some places, and when the old order melted away history came back with a vengeance. Hidden contradictions and tensions resurfaced. New wars multiplied and old ones reignited. The lack of clarity in power relations led progressively to greater unpredictability and impunity. Conflicts have become more complex and interlinked than ever before. They produce horrific violations of international humanitarian law and human rights abuses, and people have been forced to flee their homes on a scale unseen in decades. And a new threat has emerged — global terrorism. Megatrends, including climate change, population growth, rapid urbanization, food insecurity and water scarcity, have increased competition for resources and heightened tension and instability. At the same time, the past 20 years have seen extraordinary technological progress. The global economy has grown and basic social indicators have improved. The proportion of people living in absolute poverty has fallen dramatically. But globalization and technological progress have also contributed to growing inequalities. A lot of people have been left behind, including in developed countries, where millions of old jobs have disappeared and new ones are out of reach for many. In many parts of the world, youth unemployment has exploded. Globalization has also broadened the reach of organized crime and trafficking.
All of this has deepened the divide between people and political establishments. In some countries, we have seen growing instability, social unrest and even violence and conflict. In many parts of the world, voters now tend to reject the status quo, and any Government proposal is put to a referendum. Many have lost confidence not only in their Governments, but in global institutions, including the United Nations. Fear is driving the decisions of many people around the world. We must understand their anxieties and meet their needs without losing sight of our universal values. It is time to reconstruct relations between people and leaders national and international. It is time for leaders to listen and show that they care about their own people and about the global stability and solidarity on which we all depend. It is time for the United Nations to do the same — to recognize its shortcomings and reform the way it works. The Organization is the cornerstone of multilateralism and has contributed to decades of relative peace. But the challenges are now surpassing our ability to respond. The United Nations must be ready to change. Our most serious shortcoming — and here I refer to the entire international community — is our inability to prevent crises. The United Nations was born from war. Today, we must be here for peace.
(spoke in French) Prevention requires us to address root causes across the three pillars of the United Nations: peace and security, sustainable development and human rights. It must be the priority in everything we do. Prevention requires us to better support countries in strengthening their institutions and in making their societies more resilient. It also means reinstating human rights as a fundamental value to be pursued for its own sake and not as a means to a political end. All people, including minorities of every kind, must enjoy the full range of human rights — civil, political, economic, social and cultural — without discrimination. The protection and empowerment of women and girls are paramount. Gender equality is key to development and there is growing evidence of its critical role in building and maintaining peace. Prevention is not a novel concept; it is what the founders of the United Nations asked us to do. It is the best way to save lives and reduce human suffering. Where prevention fails, we must do more to resolve conflicts. From the acute crises in Syria, Yemen, South Sudan and elsewhere to long-running disputes, including the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, we need mediation, arbitration and creative diplomacy. Through my good offices, I am ready to engage personally in conflict resolution where it brings added value, while recognizing the lead role of Member States. The scale of the challenges that we face requires us to work together on a deep and continuous process of reform of the United Nations. I want to highlight here three strategic priorities for that reform: our work for peace, our support for sustainable development and our internal management. The women and men working in United Nations peace operations make a heroic contribution while putting their lives at risk. However, they are often tasked with peacekeeping where there is no peace to keep. We must therefore reach a shared understanding of the scope of peacekeeping so as to pave the way for urgent reforms. We must create a peace continuum from prevention and conflict resolution to peacekeeping, peacebuilding and development. We must build on the conclusions of the three recent reports and the parallel resolutions of the General Assembly and the Security Council. Inspired by the new concept of sustaining peace, it is time for all of us to engage in a comprehensive reform of the strategy of the United Nations, its operational setup and structures for peace and security. This reform must also include a review of our work on counter-terrorism and a better coordination mechanism among the 38 United Nations entities involved. (spoke in English) The United Nations system has not yet done enough to prevent and respond to the appalling crimes of sexual violence and exploitation committed under the flag of the United Nations against those whom we are supposed to protect. I will work closely with Member States on structural, legal and operational measures to make the zero-tolerance policy for which Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has fought so hard a reality. We must ensure transparency and accountability and offer protection and effective remedies to victims. The second key element of the reform agenda concerns the support of the United Nations to Member States in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals and the objectives of the Paris Agreement, which through their promise to leave no one behind represent an expression of global solidarity. To do this, we will reposition development at the centre of our work and engage in comprehensive reform of the United Nations development system at Headquarters and at the country level. That must involve leadership, coordination, delivery and accountability. We will build on the outcome of the recent discussions among Member States. We must also bring the humanitarian and development spheres closer together from the very beginning of a crisis in order to support affected communities, address structural and economic impacts and help prevent a new spiral of fragility and instability. Humanitarian response, sustainable development and sustaining peace are three sides of the same triangle. This approach relates to the new way of working agreed at the World Humanitarian Summit. To achieve this, we need more accountability not only at the level of each individual agency carrying out its mandate, but also in its contribution to the work of the United Nations system and of the system as a whole. A strong culture of accountability also requires effective and independent evaluation mechanisms. The third key area is management reform. We will build on existing efforts and implement recent initiatives. But looking at United Nations staff and budgetary rules and regulations, one might think some of them were designed to prevent rather than to enable the effective delivery of our mandates. We need to create a consensus around simplification, decentralization and flexibility. It benefits no one if it takes nine months to deploy a staff member to the field. The United Nations needs to be nimble, efficient and effective. It must focus more on delivery and less on process; more on people and less on bureaucracy. A culture of accountability requires strong performance management and effective protection for whistleblowers. It is not enough just to do better. We must be able to communicate better about what we do in ways that everybody understands. We need a substantial reform of our communications strategy, upgrading our tools and platforms to reach people around the world. Moreover, management reform must ensure that we reach gender parity sooner rather than later. The initial target for the equal representation of women and men among United Nations staff was the year 2000. Sixteen years later, we are far from that goal. I pledge to respect gender parity from the start in all my appointments to the Senior Management Group and the Chief Executives Board. By the end of my mandate, we should reach full gender parity at the Under-Secretary-General and Assistant Secretary-General levels, including special representatives and special envoys. We need a clear road map, with benchmarks and time frames, to achieve parity across the system well before the target of 2030. The same concern applies to regional diversity. Finally, any investment in a stronger United Nations must take staff into account. I look forward to working once again alongside the more than 85,000 men and women carrying out our mandate in 180 countries across the globe, many of whom work in difficult and sometimes dangerous circumstances. With their professionalism, expertise and dedication, they are the most important resource of the United Nations — a resource that has to be cared for, developed and used effectively, and whose voice needs to be heard. We live in a complex world. The United Nations cannot succeed alone. Partnership must be at the heart of our strategy. We should have the humility to acknowledge the essential role of other actors, while maintaining full awareness of our unique convening power. Our humanitarian and development efforts would be insignificant without the active involvement of Member States and the contributions of civil society, international financial institutions, private investors and even financial markets. Several mediation efforts and peace operations would not be possible without the engagement of regional organizations, particularly the African Union, which is our most relevant international regional partner both in peace and security and in development. (spoke in Spanish) Many important initiatives have been launched recently with our partners. We must now see them through before we introduce new ones. One missing link in our strategy is our work with young people. They have been excluded for far too long from making the decisions that will affect their futures. We must build on the work that already has been done with the support of Member States, the Youth Envoy and civil society. But this cannot be an initiative led by older people discussing the younger generation. The United Nations must empower young people, increase their participation in society and their access to education, training and jobs. (spoke in English) Today’s paradox is that despite greater connectivity, societies are becoming more fragmented. More and more people live within their own bubbles, unable to appreciate their links with the whole human family. In the end, it comes down to values, as has been said so many times today. We want the world that our children inherit to be defined by the values enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations: peace, justice, respect, human rights, tolerance and solidarity. All major religions embrace these principles, and we will strive to reflect them in our daily lives. The threats to these values are most often based on fear. Our duty to the peoples we serve is to work together to move from fear of each other to trust in each other. Trust in the values that bind us, and trust in the institutions that serve and protect us. My contribution to the United Nations will be aimed at inspiring that trust as I do my best to serve our common humanity."
10411,"Angela Merkel, Chancellor Inauguration Speech",https://www.bundesregierung.de/breg-en/news/speech-by-federal-chancellor-angela-merkel-to-the-european-parliament-strasbourg-13-november-2018-1550688,Angela Merkel,Chancellor (Germany),Inauguration Speech,2018,,"Nearly 50 years ago, Walter Hallstein, the former German Commission President, referred to European integration as an “endeavour of unparalleled boldness”. The year was 1969, ten years before the first direct European elections took place. At the time, the European Community was still in its infancy. Many of our greatest accomplishments – Schengen, the single market and a single currency – were still mere visions. But the foundation had been laid. And with that, after centuries marked by wars and dictatorships, the citizens of Europe for the first time held out hope for a sustainable, peaceful and stable future.



Today, I am pleased and grateful to be standing in front of the largest democratic parliament in the world. Together, you – 751 Members, elected in 28 member states – represent more than 500 million people. That is nearly seven percent of the world’s population. In your House, we can feel the heart of European democracy beating. The debates, which are held in 24 languages, are a sign of this. Your House also stands for another aspect of Europe, namely diversity. It is one of our great strengths as Europeans that we – time and again, and despite our diversity – have allowed ourselves to be guided by a willingness to compromise. Despite our different origins and opinions, we have so far always managed to arrive at solutions that benefit the community as a whole.



More than eleven years have passed since I first addressed this House. At the time, in 2007, Germany had assumed the Presidency of the Council of the European Union. In that speech, I spoke about diversity as a unifying, rather than dividing, factor, about freedom that constantly needs to be defended anew, and about Europe needing freedom the same way that people need air to breathe. I also talked about a fundamental value that characterises Europe – a value that brings freedom and diversity together in Europe. I spoke about tolerance. I spoke about how tolerance is the soul of Europe, about how it is an essential, fundamental value that defines European idea.



Over the past eleven years, we have also seen how much the world has changed – how, if you will, Europe’s soul has been put to the test. Global political, economic and technological challenges are developing at an ever greater pace, and they are becoming more and more profound. We have lived through a great public debt crisis. The European Union has not been spared the scourge of international terrorism. Wars and armed conflict are taking place only a few hours by plane beyond our doorstep. Global refugee and migration flows are also having a direct impact on us Europeans. The advance of digital technology is changing our way of life at breakneck speed. We are feeling the effects of climate change. Old allies are calling tried and proven alliances into question. The United Kingdom will be the first country to exit the European Union. These days are marked by intensive negotiations, and we more than ever are getting a sense of how deep that impact will be. – I want to express my heartfelt thanks to Michel Barnier for his work.



Members of this esteemed House – why am I saying this? We all realise that predicting developments has become more difficult. But we also realise something else. The likelihood that interests can be asserted at global level by a single actor is steadily decreasing. Vice versa, this means it is becoming ever more important for us Europeans to take a united stance. For this, everyone in the European Union must now more than ever show respect for others and their interests. We must now more than ever have a common understanding that tolerance is the soul of Europe, that it is a key part of what makes us European, and that only through tolerance can we develop a willingness to consider, and fully identify with, the needs and interests of others. This will help us forge true European solidarity, without which successful action is impossible. This solidarity is built on tolerance. It is the basis of our strength as Europeans. A strength that is unique in the world, for three reasons:

Firstly, solidarity is a universal value. Standing up for one another is an essential prerequisite for every functioning society. This holds true for families, villages and sports associations, as it does for a community such as the European Union. Solidarity is a fundamental component of the European treaties. It is an indispensable part of our system of values. Solidarity is encoded in our European DNA. We support countries and regions, by promoting their economic development or assisting efforts to combat youth unemployment. We help one another when natural disasters strike. When terrorist attacks or nuclear accidents occur, we stand by one another. During the European public debt crisis, we put together so-called rescue packages to help countries solve their economic and financial problems.



These few examples already show that the individual EU member states, and thereby also the citizens of the European Union, are not left in the lurch during tough times and crises. However, these few examples also show that national decisions always also have an effect on the entire community.



Therefore, secondly, solidarity always means that everyone must bear responsibility for the community as a whole. Specifically, this means anyone who undermines rule-of-law principles in their own country, or who curtails rights of the opposition and civil society and restricts the freedom of the press, thereby jeopardises the rule of law not only in his or her own country, but for everyone in Europe. Europe as a community of law can of course only function when the law applies – and is respected – equally everywhere.



Anyone who seeks to solve problems only by taking on new debt, or who ignores binding obligations, also calls into question the foundation of a strong and stable euro area. That is because our single currency can only function if every single member meets national obligations for sustainable finances. Anyone who undermines a unified European stance when interacting with third parties – regarding, for example, agreed sanctions or questions related to human rights – also undermines the credibility of European foreign policy as a whole. Because Europe will only make its voice heard in the world if it stands united. This means that showing solidarity always requires overcoming national egotisms.



I am well aware that Germany has not always behaved well, and that at times others take issue with its behaviour. For example, in the years before 2015, it took us far too long, also in Germany, to accept that the refugee issue concerns all EU member states, and that it must be dealt with through a pan-European approach.



From this it follows, thirdly, that solidarity that benefits all, also ultimately and rightly understood, means solidarity that is in everyone’s own best interest. Respecting and supporting others, on the one hand, and pursuing one’s own interests, on the other hand, are not contradictory. Quite the opposite is true. One example is our cooperation with African countries of origin in the sphere of refugees and migration. – The President addressed this just a moment ago. – This cooperation helps Europe, because it establishes more orderly, controlled and reduced movements of refugees and migrants to Europe. At the same time, it helps people in the countries of origin by improving their living conditions. We can also prevent them from embarking on what is often a perilous journey to Europe.



Another example is Europe’s commitment to worldwide climate protection. These efforts are an ecological and social necessity for protecting the resources on which life depends – also for everyone here in Europe. Europe benefits when industrialised and newly industrialising countries produce less greenhouse gasses, and when all of our economies become greener.



What is more, all Europeans benefit when the euro area, too, develops harmoniously, becoming a haven of strength and stability. All Europeans benefit when everyone joins in European civil protection efforts. All Europeans benefit when we help those who are most severely affected by displacement and migration. It is a matter of tolerance that we respect the different reactions in the various member states when it comes to the question of taking in refugees – because each member state has its own history and demographic development. However, it is a matter of solidarity that we do everything in our power to find a common approach for tackling this and other challenges as a community.



These are hallmarks of Europe: solidarity as a universal, fundamental value; solidarity as a responsibility for the community; and solidarity in terms of one’s own rational interest.



Ladies and gentlemen, unity and common resolve are essential if Europe is to succeed. I therefore want to highlight three spheres that I think should be at the top of our agenda.



Firstly, there is our foreign and security policy. We already now realise that we Europeans are much better able to defend our interests whenever we act in concert. Only by taking a united stance will Europe be strong enough to make its voice heard in the global arena and defend its values and interests. It’s simply true that the times when we could fully rely on others have ended. This means nothing other than that, if we Europeans want to survive as a community, we must make a greater effort to take our destiny into our own hands. This means that, in the long term, Europe must become more capable of taking foreign policy action. We must therefore be ready to rethink our decision-making processes, also by lifting the unanimity requirement wherever possible – that is, in areas where this is permitted by the treaties.



I have proposed that we establish a European Security Council with rotating member state membership, in which important decisions could be more swiftly prepared. We need to create a fully capable, European military force for rapid deployment to affected regions in times of crisis. We have made great progress on permanent structured cooperation in the military domain. That is a good thing, and these efforts have received wide support here.



Yet – and I say this very deliberately in view of the developments in recent years – we ought to work on the vision of one day establishing a proper European army. Yes, that’s how things stand. Four years ago, Jean-Claude Juncker said: a joint EU army would show the world that there would never again be a war between EU countries. That would not be an army in competition with NATO – don’t misunderstand me – but it could be an effective complement to NATO. Nobody wants to call traditional alliances into question. But, ladies and gentlemen, it would then be much easier to cooperate with us. When, as is the case at the moment, we have more than 160 defence or weapons systems and the United States has only 50 or 60, when each country needs its own administration, support and training for everything, we are not an efficient partner. If we want to use our financial resources efficiently and are pursuing many of the same objectives, nothing speaks against us being colllectively represented in NATO with a European army. I don’t see any contradiction there at all.



That would then also involve ... (heckling from the floor) – I welcome that response. That doesn’t bother me. I’m used to parliament. –



That, incidentally, would also involve the joint development of weapons systems within Europe. And it would also involve – this is a difficult task, also for the Federal Republic of Germany – developing a joint arms export policy, because otherwise we would not be able to present a united front in the world.



Secondly, ladies and gentlemen, Europe’s economic success is a crucial factor. It forms the basis of our strength and determines whether our voice will even be heard in the world. Without economic clout, we will have no political influence either. I am delighted that Jean-Claude Juncker’s programme, the Investment Plan for Europe, has had a significant impact in recent years and that we have already launched 340 or 350 billion euros of investments out of a total volume of 500 billion euros envisaged by 2020. That is a good programme to boost investment. I am aware of how often there have been calls for more investment, particularly from you in the European Parliament. That has now been set in motion. But we ought to discuss the issue again in due course. For, ladies and gentlemen, 340 billion euros is not peanuts, but a tangible contribution to greater prosperity in Europe.



It goes without saying that a stable and prosperous Europe also requires a stable economic and monetary union. We intend to continue to develop the European Stability Mechanism. We are working on the banking union. We are working on a eurozone budget, a concept proposed by Germany and France. In my opinion, that should be dovetailed very closely with the medium-term financial perspective. We are also advocating that liability and control go hand in hand. That means that a banking union and ultimately a European deposit guarantee system are dependent on the prior reduction of risks in the individual countries. The two are interconnected. European solidarity and individual responsibility are always two sides of the same coin. As the European Council – Germany and France at least are certainly working to achieve this – we will have tangible results to show by December.



We will also make progress on one issue that is currently being discussed in great depth and in which you, too are heavily involved – digital taxation. The question for Germany is not whether we have to implement digital taxation – that goes without saying in the digital age – our question is how to proceed. I think it is one of the rules of good democratic behaviour that we take note of the Commission’s proposals but can also supplement them. We believe that the best option in an international context would be to find an international solution. We advocate minimal taxation. But if that doesn’t work, we can’t afford to wait until doomsday, but should take a Europe-wide approach. And that, ladies and gentlemen, is what Germany is working to achieve.



If we are honest, when we look to the future and stop to think about our prosperity, we have to accept that the major innovations now no longer always or usually come from Europe, as was the case 100 years ago and 130 years ago. Today, a large proportion of ground-breaking innovations come from Asia and from the United States. That of course begs the question: Will we dictate the form of the mobility of the future on the continent which once invented the car? It bothers me, for example, that we aren’t able to manufacture battery cells. The fact that Chinese enterprises are now investing in Germany is okay. But I think we ought to make a great effort to ensure that in Europe we are also in a position to master a drive technology of the future and to make the production of battery cells possible here, too. We have the European instruments to achieve this. We have all that at our disposal – as we already do with chips today.



We need to be among the leaders in quantum computers. We need to develop a joint strategy for artificial intelligence. All this is still possible, because we have a strong industrial basis in Europe. We can build on this, and we now need to make use of it. Research and innovation are therefore central factors in our future prosperity.



Ladies and gentlemen, the third issue I want to raise is the topic of refugees and migration. During the euro crisis, we had many obstacles to overcome in order to reach a joint solution, but we succeeded. But on the issue of refugees and migration, Europe is not yet as united as I would like. As this is a central issue which concerns relations with our neighbourhood, we need to find common approaches here.



We have indeed made progress. We all agree that we need common European border management. With hindsight I will say that it was no doubt somewhat careless to create a Schengen area of free movement but only now to work on compiling entry and exit records in order to confirm who is in our country and who is leaving. Nonetheless, it is right that we are doing so now. It is right that we are developing Frontex. In my view, the Commission proposals are good. Here, too, the important point is this: If every country wants to retain its national competence and nobody wants to hand over any responsibility to the European border guards, no matter how extensive and how competent they are, they will not be able to do their job. In this area, too, we need to forego our national competences to some degree and work together.



We also need to consider how we can best share the workload with regard to development assistance, development cooperation and economic development in Africa. We are now seeing outstanding results – that wouldn’t have been possible two or three years ago – when individual member states work in cooperation with the Commission in specific African countries and thereby achieve so much more than if we all headed off there to do our own thing. Yet we have a great deal more to learn in this area. Nonetheless, I believe we are moving in the right direction.



Another priority needs to be for us to develop a common European asylum procedure. If every country makes decisions based on different criteria, the people affected are aware of this and then it is no wonder that secondary movement takes place within the Schengen area. It is vital that just as we are developing a common level playing field for the internal market, we make the effort to develop common standards also on such sensitive issues as asylum law and humanitarian responsibility. Otherwise we will not be able to handle the task with which refugees and migration confront us.



Ladies and gentlemen, those were just three examples of many. The protests show that I have hit the mark. That is good, and I am honoured. I believe that people want Europe to tackle the very issues that are uppermost in their minds. People want a Europe that provides answers to their burning questions. That doesn’t mean that Europe has to have a finger in every pie, as it were. It is still the case that not every problem in Europe is a problem for Europe. Solidarity does not mean omnipresence. But solidarity does mean that Europe engages itself where it is needed and that it is then able to act firmly, decisively and effectively.



I am convinced that Europe is our best chance for lasting peace, lasting prosperity and a secure future. Our gathering in Paris at the invitation of the French President to remember the brutalities of the First World War 100 years ago ought to have reminded us once again what happens when nations have no respect for one another and what happens when alliances such as the League of Nations, which was founded in the wake of the First World War, fail. Even greater horrors followed. This is why we cannot afford to squander this European opportunity. We owe that to ourselves, we owe it to generations past, and we owe it to future generations. That means that nationalism and egoism must never again be allowed to gain a foothold in Europe. Rather, tolerance and solidarity are our common future. Ladies and gentlemen, that is something absolutely worth striving for.



Thank you very much."

Since I am only the fourth woman to occupy this position in the 73 years of the life of the United Nations, I want to reiterate that I am dedicating my presidency to all the women in the world — to women who are entering politics, to those who are struggling for equality in the workplace, to women and girls who are victims of violence and to young girls and adolescents who are demanding access to quality information and education. Three great women have presided over the Assembly in the past 72 years: Vijaya Lakshmi Pandit, of India, in 1953; Angie E. Brooks, of Liberia, in 1969; and Sheikha Haya Rashed Al Khalifa, of the Kingdom of Bahrain, in 2006. My tribute and homage goes to them and to the legacy they have left at the Organization. I also want to thank my predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Miroslav Lajčák, whose work during the seventysecond session was exemplary. I intend to build on his achievements and good practices, especially his morning dialogues and monthly coordination meetings with the principal organs of the Organization. We thank President Lajcák for his leadership, which has always included inclusive dialogue and a cooperative spirit. We wish him every success in his work as he returns to his beloved country, our sister Republic of Slovakia. I have tried to learn as much as possible in these short weeks of transition. In that time, I have had the support of the Permanent Mission of Ecuador, the representatives of the States that have contributed to the staff of the Office of the President of the General Assembly and the support of the professional staff of the United Nations system. I want to inform members that we are ready to begin the work of the Assembly. I would also like to thank the Secretary-General for his support during the transition period and for his advice and commitment to the Organization. In accordance with my mandate from the States, I am ready to support the Secretary-General in all his initiatives aimed at strengthening the operations of the United Nations system and thereby to improve the efficiency and impact of the Organization’s work in the field. The General Assembly is not just the most democratic and representative organ of the United Nations, it is a forum encompassing the most diverse knowledge, cultures and professions of the world. In fact, it constitutes the world’s largest and most influential centre of global thought. Our thinking, knowledge and vision set the standards for cooperation among our nations and between our Governments and peoples. Every day we work together to search for solutions to the most difficult problems facing humankind. In the past 72 years, the Assembly has produced and codified a body of the most important aspects of international law and human rights. Despite our many achievements, however, great challenges remain. We have made significant progress in decolonization, but there is still a pending agenda. Every day we work together to build peace and prevent conflicts, but the scourge of war is still present. We have made significant progress with agreements to protect the environment and slow climate change, but nature and the planet still continue to suffer and are at serious risk, even threatening the survival of humankind. We have reached important agreements protecting indigenous peoples and nationalities, but they remain the poorest of the poor. We have made significant progress on the development agenda, starting with the Millennium Development Goals, but significant challenges remain, and they are now included in the Sustainable Development Goals. Those are just a few examples. 
We must all be aware that the Organization still has many challenges and obligations. Some are beginning to be met, such as addressing the migration phenomenon through an internationally agreed-on instrument, which will undoubtedly be one of the most important milestones that we will witness this session. It is my hope that we will be able to witness the fulfilment of other major outstanding obligations of the Organization, such as resolving the situation of the brotherly Palestinian people. We must also adapt to new times. The Assembly must address the impact of new technologies on the world of work, communications and social coexistence, for example. The contribution of the United Nations to humankind has been immense. However, its impact and relevance would be even greater if our peoples felt that what we were discussing and agreeing on here was — as is indeed the case — something that directly concerned them. We have not succeeded in getting our peoples to connect our work to their daily lives. Making the United Nations more relevant to all people will therefore be the main focus of my work during this session. If we can manage to establish that connection in the short term, it will have a double effect. First, it will bring us as an Organization closer to society, to the people, thereby highlighting our role in their lives and their most pressing needs; and secondly, our peoples would become our greatest allies in implementing the agreements we reach in the Assembly at the national level. Please allow me to be a little didactic, therefore, and to address those who perhaps do not know what is currently going on in the Assembly. Today is the beginning of a new session of the General Assembly, the most important representative and decision-making organ of the United Nations. Over the next 12 months, the 193 States represented here will debate approximately 330 draft resolutions on an equal number of topics, all of great global interest. We have scheduled nearly 100 plenary meetings and an indefinite number of working meetings and negotiations. This year we will also take up 34 mandates on various topics of global interest and hold 18 summits, forums and high-level meetings. Finally, during this session we will be responsible for leading and facilitating 13 intergovernmental processes on extremely important issues, such as Security Council reform, the revitalization of the General Assembly and the alignment of the General Assembly with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. That may sound very obvious to all of us, but I assure everyone that it is not obvious to the great majority of people. For that reason, I have emphasized to the communication teams of the Secretariat the importance of further highlighting the work of the Assembly. Communication should therefore be a priority during this session. The items on the regular programme of work and the mandates entrusted to me are many and will be duly implemented, with everyone’s support. However, as usual, after my dialogues with many people in the Assembly, including leaders and representatives of several States, and after analysing the most pressing global issues, I can now propose the following seven priority themes for this session. First, gender equality and the empowerment of women must remain a priority until they are definitively achieved. I will promote the empowerment of women and girls from all fronts. Life is better for all of us when everyone is on a level playing field and human rights are accessible to all, without discrimination. Second, we will prioritize the promotion and implementation of the new global compacts on migration and refugees. It is our duty to seek protection for millions of refugees around the world and direct our efforts towards safe, orderly and regular migration. The Intergovernmental Conference to Adopt the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration, to be held in December in Morocco, will be a major milestone in that direction. Third, we will prioritize the creation of decent work opportunities for young people, women and persons with disabilities. That will be one of the most important challenges for public policies related to the development and sustainability of social security systems. Fourth, I will work to bring greater attention to environmental protection. The General Assembly must become a voice that calls for public awareness of pollution by plastic waste as a pervasive environmental hazard that affects the health and well-being of people and ecosystems around the world. We will also pave the way for the United Nations 2019 Climate Summit, announced by the Secretary-General. Fifth, we will prioritize the importance of strengthening political and social commitment to persons with disabilities. There is still a need for greater awareness of that population’s specific needs. 
Accessibility, inclusive and quality education and decent employment are challenges faced by humankind’s largest minority, persons with disabilities. Sixth, we will prioritize the revitalization of the United Nations. We will work in three areas: implementing reforms of the United Nations system; strengthening the process of revitalizing the General Assembly to optimize its working methods and enhance its deliberative and decision-making role; and continuing the process of the reform of the Security Council, in line with the will and commitment of States. Seventh, we will make peace and security a hugely important priority. The armed conflicts that are currently ongoing can only cause all of us the deepest pain. The security problems experienced by many of our societies also represent an enormous challenge for Governments and for the Organization. The Assembly must become the principal peacebuilding organ through a preventive approach. Sustainable peace must be rooted in dialogue and understanding, and facilitating that dialogue will be my priority. In addition, we all recognize the fundamental role that young people play in building safe societies and preventing conflicts. The General Assembly must promote efforts to ensure that young people have greater opportunities and thereby prevent the kinds of conditions that inevitably lead them to violent extremism. Two major concepts and strategic visions will be part of my work this year — peace and human rights for all, and strengthened multilateralism with global leadership and shared responsibilities. The seven priorities I mentioned are geared around those concepts and, while ambitious, will guide my work during this session to achieve our goal of building a more relevant United Nations for all. One of the most effective ways to measure the Organization’s impact is undoubtedly in the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The greatest indicator of the success of the work of the Assembly is the well-being of people, in their daily lives and prospects for the future. That impact will ultimately ensure that the United Nations continues to be relevant and valuable to the world. The agenda is enormous. My role will be to encourage dialogue and facilitate consensus-building during consultations and ongoing discussions so as to enable us to take action-oriented decisions.
We are now beginning a new session, with an intense agenda for the final week of September. We are finalizing preparations for the Nelson Mandela Peace Summit, to be held on 24 September. The event, in honour of the hundredth anniversary of Madiba’s birth, will provide all States with a historic opportunity to present their views on how to prevent conflict and give renewed impetus to building peaceful societies. The nine days of the general debate will begin on 25 September. Once again, leaders will be able to listen and be heard in the only forum that exists for the purpose, the General Assembly. It is in this Hall that all nations are equal, with the same seat, the same button to vote and the same right to ask to speak, as well as to listen and be heard. I encourage delegations to be present in the General Assembly Hall when our Heads of State and Government deliver their statements. It is only by knowing and listening to each other that we will be able to advance our common aspirations for peace, security, human rights and sustainable development. I want to assure members that, with the participation of all States, I will support and lead efforts to make a success of all the high-level meetings and conferences, on health, climate change, South-South cooperation and middle-income countries, among other mandates. It is in my interest, as well as that of members, to ensure that our deliberations lead to useful and concrete recommendations. As I said on the day of my election (see A/72/PV.92), I want to assure the Assembly that I will abide with absolute responsibility by the code of ethics for the President of the General Assembly and by the precepts of the Charter of the United Nations and the rules of procedure of the General Assembly. During this session we will mark the seventieth anniversary of the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Resolution 217/A (III), of 10 December 1948, was perhaps one of the most important resolutions ever adopted by the Assembly, as it marked the beginning of a new era, that of the universalization of human rights. We are sometimes not aware that every day we are making history with the resolutions adopted in this Hall. Let us continue together to make history and to build a world that is more egalitarian and free, more sustainable and respective of nature and with greater inclusivity and solidarity. I now give the floor to the Secretary-General of the United Nations, His Excellency Mr. António Guterres.
The Secretary-General (spoke in Spanish): Let me start by again congratulating Her Excellency Ms. María Fernanda Espinosa Garcés of Ecuador on her election as President of the General Assembly at its seventythird session. (spoke in English) Ms. Espinosa Garcés brings wide-ranging diplomatic and intergovernmental experience to the role, as well as deep knowledge of the international agenda. She already knows the United Nations quite well, having served as Permanent Representative in Geneva. Of course, in addition to being the first woman to become her country’s Permanent Representative, she is now the fourth to serve as President of the General Assembly — and the first in more than a decade. I am sure that additional perspective will enrich and advance our work. Your presence, Madam President, is a guarantee that gender parity is on the move. We have a busy session ahead of us. We need action for peacekeeping, gender parity, financing for the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, empowerment for the world’s young people, urgent steps to end poverty and conflict, and much else. I encourage members to tell their leaders to come to next week’s high-level week ready to be bold and forge solutions to our global challenges. Looking further ahead, there are important gatherings on the calendar that can solidify progress on key global challenges. The twenty-fourth session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change will gather in Poland in December. Climate impacts continue to worsen and accelerate, and our actions and ambitions are nowhere near where they need to be to avoid catastrophe. Fortunately, technology is on our side, and much is happening towards a green economy that we can build on. Let us make sure that Katowice is a success. Also in December, Heads of State and Government will meet in Marrakech to formally adopt a landmark global compact for safe, orderly and regular migration. Implementing the compact should help us reap the widespread benefits of migration while protecting people against dangerous journeys, exploitation and discrimination. I look forward to its formal adoption. The Assembly has a vital role to play on those and all other issues. At a time of fragmentation and polarization, the world needs the Assembly to show the value of international cooperation. The Secretariat and I are committed to supporting and strengthening the ways in which we work together. I wish you, Madam President, and all Member States every success as we strive to achieve our shared goals.

10417,"Boris Johnson, PM Inauguration Speech",https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-49102495,Boris Johnson,Prime Minister (United Kingdom),Inauguration Speech,2019,,"Good afternoon.

I have just been to see Her Majesty the Queen who has invited me to form a government and I have accepted.

I pay tribute to the fortitude and patience of my predecessor and her deep sense of public service.

But in spite of all her efforts, it has become clear that there are pessimists at home and abroad who think that after three years of indecision, that this country has become a prisoner to the old arguments of 2016 and that in this home of democracy we are incapable of honouring a basic democratic mandate.


And so I am standing before you today to tell you, the British people, that those critics are wrong.

The doubters, the doomsters, the gloomsters - they are going to get it wrong again.

The people who bet against Britain are going to lose their shirts, because we are going to restore trust in our democracy and we are going to fulfil the repeated promises of Parliament to the people and come out of the EU on October 31, no ifs or buts.

And we will do a new deal, a better deal that will maximise the opportunities of Brexit while allowing us to develop a new and exciting partnership with the rest of Europe, based on free trade and mutual support.

I have every confidence that in 99 days' time we will have cracked it. But you know what - we aren't going to wait 99 days, because the British people have had enough of waiting.

The time has come to act, to take decisions, to give strong leadership and to change this country for the better.

And though the Queen has just honoured me with this extraordinary office of state my job is to serve you, the people.

Because if there is one point we politicians need to remember, it is that the people are our bosses.

My job is to make your streets safer - and we are going to begin with another 20,000 police on the streets and we start recruiting forthwith.

My job is to make sure you don't have to wait 3 weeks to see your GP - and we start work this week, with 20 new hospital upgrades, and ensuring that money for the NHS really does get to the front line.

My job is to protect you or your parents or grandparents from the fear of having to sell your home to pay for the costs of care.

And so I am announcing now - on the steps of Downing Street - that we will fix the crisis in social care once and for all with a clear plan we have prepared to give every older person the dignity and security they deserve.

My job is to make sure your kids get a superb education, wherever they are in the country - and that's why we have already announced that we are going to level up per pupil funding in primary and secondary schools.

And that is the work that begins immediately behind that black door.

And though I am today building a great team of men and women, I will take personal responsibility for the change I want to see.

Never mind the backstop - the buck stops here.

And I will tell you something else about my job. It is to be prime minister of the whole United Kingdom.

And that means uniting our country, answering at last the plea of the forgotten people and the left-behind towns by physically and literally renewing the ties that bind us together.

So that with safer streets and better education and fantastic new road and rail infrastructure and full fibre broadband we level up across Britain with higher wages, and a higher living wage, and higher productivity.

We close the opportunity gap, giving millions of young people the chance to own their own homes and giving business the confidence to invest across the UK.

Because it is time we unleashed the productive power not just of London and the South East, but of every corner of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.

The awesome foursome that are incarnated in that red, white, and blue flag - who together are so much more than the sum of their parts, and whose brand and political personality is admired and even loved around the world.

For our inventiveness, for our humour, for our universities, our scientists, our armed forces, our diplomacy for the equalities on which we insist - whether race or gender or LGBT or the right of every girl in the world to 12 years of quality education - and for the values we stand for around the world

Everyone knows the values that flag represents.

It stands for freedom and free speech and habeas corpus and the rule of law, and above all it stands for democracy.

And that is why we will come out of the EU on October 31.

Because in the end, Brexit was a fundamental decision by the British people that they wanted their laws made by people that they can elect and they can remove from office.

And we must now respect that decision, and create a new partnership with our European friends - as warm and as close and as affectionate as possible.

And the first step is to repeat unequivocally our guarantee to the 3.2 million EU nationals now living and working among us, and I say directly to you - thank you for your contribution to our society.

Thank you for your patience, and I can assure you that under this government you will get the absolute certainty of the rights to live and remain.

And next I say to our friends in Ireland, and in Brussels and around the EU: I am convinced that we can do a deal without checks at the Irish border, because we refuse under any circumstances to have such checks and yet without that anti-democratic backstop.

And it is of course vital at the same time that we prepare for the remote possibility that Brussels refuses any further to negotiate, and we are forced to come out with no deal, not because we want that outcome - of course not - but because it is only common sense to prepare.

And let me stress that there is a vital sense in which those preparations cannot be wasted, and that is because under any circumstances we will need to get ready at some point in the near future to come out of the EU customs union and out of regulatory control, fully determined at last to take advantage of Brexit.

Because that is the course on which this country is now set.

With high hearts and growing confidence, we will now accelerate the work of getting ready.

And the ports will be ready and the banks will be ready, and the factories will be ready, and business will be ready, and the hospitals will be ready, and our amazing food and farming sector will be ready and waiting to continue selling ever more, not just here but around the world.

And don't forget that in the event of a no deal outcome, we will have the extra lubrication of the £39 billion, and whatever deal we do we will prepare this autumn for an economic package to boost British business and to lengthen this country's lead as the number one destination in this continent for overseas investment.

And to all those who continue to prophesy disaster, I say yes - there will be difficulties, though I believe that with energy and application they will be far less serious than some have claimed.

But if there is one thing that has really sapped the confidence of business over the last three years, it is not the decisions we have taken - it is our refusal to take decisions.

And to all those who say we cannot be ready, I say do not underestimate this country.

Do not underestimate our powers of organisation and our determination, because we know the enormous strengths of this economy in life sciences, in tech, in academia, in music, the arts, culture, financial services.

It is here in Britain that we are using gene therapy, for the first time, to treat the most common form of blindness.

Here in Britain that we are leading the world in the battery technology that will help cut CO2 and tackle climate change and produce green jobs for the next generation.

And as we prepare for a post-Brexit future, it is time we looked not at the risks but at the opportunities that are upon us.

So let us begin work now to create free ports that will drive growth and thousands of high-skilled jobs in left-behind areas.

Let's start now to liberate the UK's extraordinary bioscience sector from anti-genetic modification rules, and let's develop the blight-resistant crops that will feed the world.

Let's get going now on our own position navigation and timing satellite and earth observation systems - UK assets orbiting in space, with all the long term strategic and commercial benefits for this country.

Let's change the tax rules to provide extra incentives to invest in capital and research.

And let's promote the welfare of animals that has always been so close to the hearts of the British people.

And yes, let's start now on those free trade deals - because it is free trade that has done more than anything else to lift billions out of poverty.

All this and more we can do now and only now, at this extraordinary moment in our history.

And after three years of unfounded self-doubt, it is time to change the record.

To recover our natural and historic role as an enterprising, outward-looking and truly global Britain, generous in temper and engaged with the world.

No one in the last few centuries has succeeded in betting against the pluck and nerve and ambition of this country.

They will not succeed today.

We in this government will work flat out to give this country the leadership it deserves, and that work begins now.

Thank you very much."
10420,"Tijjani Muhammad-Bande, PGA Inauguration Speech",http://undocs.org/A/74/PV.1,Tijjani Muhammad-Bande,President of the General Assembly,Inauguration Speech,2019,,"The President: I am honoured to address everyone present today as President of the seventy-fourth session of the United Nations General Assembly. I am grateful to all Member States for the confidence placed in me and assure them of my commitment to upholding the ethics of the Office of the President of the General Assembly and the principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations. I thank former President María Fernanda Espinosa Garcés for her excellent stewardship and tireless efforts in guiding our work during the seventy-third session. I am also grateful to the Secretary-General for his leadership and commitment to the United Nations and its ideals. In preparing to take office, I interacted with all delegations and am grateful for their inputs intended to better frame and deepen our vision statement, which belongs to us all. It is now time for the implementation of our plans, for which I count on the Assembly’s continued support. Our vision statement is focused on the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals, particularly poverty eradication, zero hunger, quality education, climate action and inclusion. Accordingly, I will, with the Assembly’s kind support and guidance, pay close attention to the effective implementation of inherited mandates and the following priorities, which I enumerated in my vision statement and at the dialogue with Member States prior to my election. With regard to the promotion of peace and security, particularly conflict prevention, I will collaborate and coordinate with the Security Council and the Secretariat to ensure that greater attention is paid to prevention rather than reaction to full-blown conflict. I will also advocate for effective early-detection and warning systems, as well as for mediation, negotiation and peaceful settlement of ongoing conflicts. I will work to foster cooperation to address the drivers of conflict, such as poverty, exclusion and illiteracy. Secondly, I will focus on increased partnerships for the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals, particularly poverty eradication, zero hunger and quality education. During this session I urge all Member States to share their experiences on poverty eradication, especially on how improved social-protection systems can benefit vulnerable people who are the most affected by poverty. I request all members to focus on how best to strengthen the United Nations system to ensure that the most vulnerable escape the debilitating web of poverty and hunger by sharing knowledge on sustainable foodproduction systems, resilient agricultural practices, availability of productive and affordable agricultural machinery, and expansion of entrepreneurial capacity. Thirdly, quality education is important, and the fact that no nation can develop past its educational capacity, in particular that of its teachers, means that we must work to ensure that Member States can partner on teacher training and access to free and quality primary and secondary education, inter alia. In some communities, what is needed is to build schools, while in many others the focus needs to be on the safety of students. We must devise means to attend to the educational needs of all. Fourthly, climate change remains a key issue in development, and we must tackle its causes and its repercussions. The recent emergencies in the Bahamas, Mozambique and the Sahel region, among others, remind us of the urgent need to strengthen global action. We must find a way to strengthen that action to tackle climate change. Fifthly, accentuating inclusion, starting within our Organization in particular, is important. We must continue to ensure that the rights and empowerment of young people, women and the disabled around the world are prioritized. Without a doubt, we need to forge partnerships to accelerate the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals and diligently work to find innovative ways to bridge financial gaps. In one week, our Heads of State and Government will gather in this Hall for the general debate. In parallel, they will also devote attention to the Climate Action Summit, the high-level meeting on universal health coverage, the Sustainable Development Goals summit, the commemoration of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the High-Level Dialogue on Financing for Development, the International Day for the Total Elimination of Nuclear Weapons and the mid-term review of the Small Island Developing States Accelerated Modalities of Action Pathway. During that week, they will deliberate on issues that are key to improving the lives of billions of people around. the world and affirm policies designed to accentuate development. The outcomes of the deliberations during the high-level week will guide our work during the rest of the session. We must never forget that the world looks up to the United Nations as a veritable vehicle for attaining peace and security, sustainable development and universal human rights. As the most representative deliberative body of the United Nations, the General Assembly needs to redouble its efforts aimed at bridging gaps and act for the common good of the people we serve, in particular as we prepare to celebrate the seventy-fifth anniversary of the Organization’s founding, and in line with the farsighted vision of its founders. We must build trust in one another, deepen partnerships and show empathy. This is the only way to resolve the many challenges we face. We will have to strive together to deliver for all. In conclusion, I wish to reiterate that during the seventy-fourth session of the General Assembly, the Office of the President will work closely with the Presidents of the Security Council and of the Economic and Social Council as well as the Secretary-General to better ensure success in achieving our shared goals. Although I am cognizant of the competing demands that will burden Member States during this period and beyond, I will continue to knock on their doors and count on their support to make this session of the General Assembly a productive and even a pleasant one. This was what each and every delegation had assured me they will do. I am therefore most assured that we will achieve much during the session. I now give the floor to the Secretary-General of the United Nations, His Excellency Mr. António Guterres.
The Secretary-General: I am pleased to be with everyone present for the opening of the seventy-fourth session of the General Assembly. Let me begin by warmly congratulating His Excellency Mr. Tijjani Muhammad-Bande of Nigeria on his election as President of the General Assembly. As Nigeria’s Permanent Representative here in New York, Mr. MuhammadBande brings years of United Nations experience to this role. He also brings valuable insights into some of the pressing peace and security, human rights and sustainable development challenges facing this body, from the spread of violent extremism to the threat of the global climate crisis. I commend the priorities he set in June: peace and security, poverty eradication, zero hunger, quality education, climate action and inclusion are all central to the sustainable development agenda. I also applaud his emphasis on human rights and gender parity, beginning here at the United Nations. We have a busy year ahead of us, beginning with five critical summits on climate action, the Sustainable Development Goals, financing for development, universal health care and small island developing States. In all these areas, multi-stakeholder engagement will be essential. I welcome the President’s commitment to partnerships as well as his determination to strengthen the relationship between the General Assembly and the Economic and Social Council. Next year, during the seventy-fourth session, we will celebrate the seventy-fifth anniversary of the founding of our Organization. Today’s world is rapidly changing. Our challenges are global and increasingly interlinked. As we enter a decade of action on the Sustainable Development Goals, and as we ask for greater urgency and ambition on climate change, with 2020 being a crucial year, we have to convince people that the United Nations is relevant to all and that multilateralism offers real solutions to global challenges. People’s expectations of our Organization, especially the General Assembly and Security Council, are profound. One thing that concerns me in particular, and was echoed by the President-elect in June, is the trust deficit between nations. Transparency, dialogue and greater understanding are essential to alleviating mistrust. The General Assembly is a unique and indispensable forum where the world can come together to advance on sensitive and important issues. It is vital that the world have strong and effective multilateral institutions and architecture and that international relations be based on international law. We are and will remain an intergovernmental organization. At the same time, we need forms of more intense cooperation with other international and regional organizations — a networked multilateralism — as well as closer contacts with businesses, civil society and other stakeholders — an inclusive multilateralism. Such a networked and inclusive multilateralism will help us overcome the challenges of our current era. As we open the seventy-fourth session of the General Assembly, let me wish all delegations a busy and successful year as we work together to achieve our common goals of peace, prosperity and opportunity for all on a healthy planet."
10424,"Volkan Bozkir, PGA Vision Statement",https://www.un.org/pga/74/wp-content/uploads/sites/99/2020/05/Vision-Statement-by-Volkan-Bozk%C4%B1r.pdf,Volkan Bozkir,President of the General Assembly,Inauguration Speech,2020,,"During my term of office, I will represent the membership as a whole, take the views and interest of all member states into account and reconcile them to the best of my abilities. In line with the existing scope of the PGA’s mandate, I will be the guardian of the rules of procedure of the General Assembly. Herein, I will ensure smooth implementation of the agenda and efficient management of the sessions and I will abide by the code of ethics of the PGA. I find it important that the Secretary General and the PGA work in harmony. My efforts and activities will therefore complement the agenda and priorities of the Secretary General. Among other things, this means supporting the implementation of the UN reform agenda and the 2020 vision of the Secretary-General. Within this framework, I will also work towards consolidating the much needed trust and cohesion among the UN member states, major groups of countries and other international organizations. The President of the 75th session of the General Assembly already has a wide range of mandates deriving from previous sessions. Taking into account the existing heavy workload of delegations, especially small ones, I do not intend to start new initiatives or create new fields of GA work. I will choose quality over quantity. In this respect, I will aim for a streamlined working agenda and concrete results and observe the balance between the three pillars of the UN work. I will also guide the work of the General Assembly in an effective, transparent and inclusive manner. I will allow continuity with the work of the previous PGA’s through building on their achievements and successful initiatives and make improvements where necessary. The views and suggestions of member states will be essential to make this possible. The overall agenda of our organization requires close coordination among the UN decision-making bodies. I will try to address the gaps and duplications in different agendas. I will regularly raise these issues during the monthly meetings with the Presidents of other main organs of the Organization, including the Security Council and the ECOSOC, as well as with the UN Secretary-General. The issues I will give priority to during my term: 1) We are commemorating the 75th anniversary of the UN under the theme “The future we want, the United Nations we need; reaffirming our collective commitment to multilateralism”. This overall theme shall guide the general debate of the 75th session in addition to all other activities, meetings and conferences organized by the UN in 2020. We should take full advantage of this historic anniversary to underline the irreplaceable nature of the rules-based international system, as well as the imperative to consolidate it. The principle of multilateralism and a rules-based international system are also essential to fulfil the core mandates prescribed in the Charter of the UN. As the 75th anniversary program concerns both 74th and 75th PGAs, in order to ensure continuity and coherence, I will be closely coordinating the preparations and the implementation of the 75th anniversary celebrations with the current PGA. 2) I intend to place an emphasis on the need to advance the UN collective agenda for humanity with particular attention to vulnerable groups, people in need and the people under oppression. This agenda provides us with an opportunity to see where we stand in addressing humanitarian needs, reducing vulnerability and increasing resilience. The UN is the most important platform to give voice to the most vulnerable, namely, refugees, immigrants, and stateless persons. Hence, we also need to look at our objective of achieving the SDGs with an emphasis on humanitarian action in a world of growing inequalities. I will especially endeavour to contribute to the efforts of the international community and the UN initiatives to ensure impartial and unhindered delivery of humanitarian assistance and full respect for international humanitarian law in conflicts and crises. 3) SDGs are the most transformative set of objectives, yet they cannot be achieved without strengthened global partnership. To support this within my mandate, I will be working closely with the Deputy Secretary General. As we enter the “SDG Decade of Action”, we need to ensure that countries in special situations, including Least Developed Countries (LDCs), remain a priority as they are lagging behind the most in SDG implementation.
As it happily coincides with my term, the Fifth United Nations Conference of the Least Developed Countries to be held in Doha from March 21-25th, 2021, will be an opportunity for renewed and strengthened partnership. Applying emerging technologies accelerates the impact of SDGs especially for the most vulnerable. I will attach special importance to result oriented action when it comes to addressing the complex development needs of the LDCs. In this respect, I hope we can benefit from the experience gained during the formation of the UN Technology Bank for the LDC’s, which was the first ever SDG target to be achieved. 4) Throughout my professional life, I have been fully committed to the goals of improving the living standards and the rights of women, ensuring their full and equal participation in all spheres of life and strengthening their status within society. I wholeheartedly support the Secretary-General in his objective of achieving gender parity at all levels at the United Nations. Women have been active agents of positive change. In this respect, women can play a unique role in reviving our collective commitment to multilateralism and a more inclusive vision for a better future. The high-level meeting of the General Assembly on the 25th anniversary of the Fourth World Conference on Women, to be held on September 23, 2020 in the margins of the general debate, will be instrumental in accelerating the realization of gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls.
My principles: Like my predecessors, I will be working with a multi-national team. The principles of professionalism, merit and expertise, as well as, regional and gender balance will determine the composition of my team. I intend to keep the size of the team not larger than necessary. The valuable contributions of member states will be most welcome to make this team effort a success. In the execution of my responsibilities, I will work closely with the representatives of member states as colleagues. Consensus building will be one of my core efforts during my tenure. To this end, I will use, to the extent possible, the moral authority and soft power of the PGA. Efficiency, effectiveness, accountability and non-discrimination will be the guiding principles of my Presidency and my team will operate on the basis of openness, inclusivity and transparency. 
As last word The coronavirus-COVID 19 pandemic and the measures taken to contain its spread have recently emphasized that the agenda and the activities of the UN should focus on these issues directly affecting our citizens across continents. Close coordination within the wider UN system, adopting a holistic approach and efficient use of our time will be the key to our success. Depending on the developments in the period ahead, I, as the President of the 75th session, will contribute with the best of my abilities to the collective efforts of the international community to fight against this pandemic and mitigate its consequences."

This is America’s day.

This is democracy’s day.

A day of history and hope.

Of renewal and resolve.

Through a crucible for the ages America has been tested anew and America has risen to the challenge.

Today, we celebrate the triumph not of a candidate, but of a cause, the cause of democracy.

The will of the people has been heard and the will of the people has been heeded.

We have learned again that democracy is precious.

Democracy is fragile.

And at this hour, my friends, democracy has prevailed.

So now, on this hallowed ground where just days ago violence sought to shake this Capitol’s very foundation, we come together as one nation, under God, indivisible, to carry out the peaceful transfer of power as we have for more than two centuries.

We look ahead in our uniquely American way – restless, bold, optimistic – and set our sights on the nation we know we can be and we must be.

I thank my predecessors of both parties for their presence here.

I thank them from the bottom of my heart.

You know the resilience of our Constitution and the strength of our nation.

As does President Carter, who I spoke to last night but who cannot be with us today, but whom we salute for his lifetime of service.

I have just taken the sacred oath each of these patriots took — an oath first sworn by George Washington.

But the American story depends not on any one of us, not on some of us, but on all of us.

On “We the People” who seek a more perfect Union.

This is a great nation and we are a good people.

Over the centuries through storm and strife, in peace and in war, we have come so far. But we still have far to go.

We will press forward with speed and urgency, for we have much to do in this winter of peril and possibility.

Much to repair.

Much to restore.

Much to heal.

Much to build.

And much to gain.

Few periods in our nation’s history have been more challenging or difficult than the one we’re in now.

A once-in-a-century virus silently stalks the country.

It’s taken as many lives in one year as America lost in all of World War II.

Millions of jobs have been lost.

Hundreds of thousands of businesses closed.

A cry for racial justice some 400 years in the making moves us. The dream of justice for all will be deferred no longer.

A cry for survival comes from the planet itself. A cry that can’t be any more desperate or any more clear.

And now, a rise in political extremism, white supremacy, domestic terrorism that we must confront and we will defeat.

To overcome these challenges – to restore the soul and to secure the future of America – requires more than words.

It requires that most elusive of things in a democracy:

Unity.

Unity.

In another January in Washington, on New Year’s Day 1863, Abraham Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation.

When he put pen to paper, the President said, “If my name ever goes down into history it will be for this act and my whole soul is in it.”

My whole soul is in it.

Today, on this January day, my whole soul is in this:

Bringing America together.

Uniting our people.

And uniting our nation.

I ask every American to join me in this cause.

Uniting to fight the common foes we face:

Anger, resentment, hatred.

Extremism, lawlessness, violence.

Disease, joblessness, hopelessness.

With unity we can do great things. Important things.

We can right wrongs.

We can put people to work in good jobs.

We can teach our children in safe schools.

We can overcome this deadly virus.

We can reward work, rebuild the middle class, and make health care
secure for all.

We can deliver racial justice.

We can make America, once again, the leading force for good in the world.

I know speaking of unity can sound to some like a foolish fantasy.

I know the forces that divide us are deep and they are real.

But I also know they are not new.

Our history has been a constant struggle between the American ideal that we are all created equal and the harsh, ugly reality that racism, nativism, fear, and demonization have long torn us apart.

The battle is perennial.

Victory is never assured.

Through the Civil War, the Great Depression, World War, 9/11, through struggle, sacrifice, and setbacks, our “better angels” have always prevailed.

In each of these moments, enough of us came together to carry all of us forward.

And, we can do so now.

History, faith, and reason show the way, the way of unity.

We can see each other not as adversaries but as neighbors.

We can treat each other with dignity and respect.

We can join forces, stop the shouting, and lower the temperature.

For without unity, there is no peace, only bitterness and fury.

No progress, only exhausting outrage.

No nation, only a state of chaos.

This is our historic moment of crisis and challenge, and unity is the path forward.

And, we must meet this moment as the United States of America.

If we do that, I guarantee you, we will not fail.

We have never, ever, ever failed in America when we have acted together.

And so today, at this time and in this place, let us start afresh.

All of us.

Let us listen to one another.

Hear one another.
See one another.

Show respect to one another.

Politics need not be a raging fire destroying everything in its path.

Every disagreement doesn’t have to be a cause for total war.

And, we must reject a culture in which facts themselves are manipulated and even manufactured.

My fellow Americans, we have to be different than this.

America has to be better than this.

And, I believe America is better than this.

Just look around.

Here we stand, in the shadow of a Capitol dome that was completed amid the Civil War, when the Union itself hung in the balance.

Yet we endured and we prevailed.

Here we stand looking out to the great Mall where Dr. King spoke of his dream.

Here we stand, where 108 years ago at another inaugural, thousands of protestors tried to block brave women from marching for the right to vote.

Today, we mark the swearing-in of the first woman in American history elected to national office – Vice President Kamala Harris.

Don’t tell me things can’t change.

Here we stand across the Potomac from Arlington National Cemetery, where heroes who gave the last full measure of devotion rest in eternal peace.

And here we stand, just days after a riotous mob thought they could use violence to silence the will of the people, to stop the work of our democracy, and to drive us from this sacred ground.

That did not happen.

It will never happen.

Not today.

Not tomorrow.

Not ever.

To all those who supported our campaign I am humbled by the faith you have placed in us.

To all those who did not support us, let me say this: Hear me out as we move forward. Take a measure of me and my heart.

And if you still disagree, so be it.

That’s democracy. That’s America. The right to dissent peaceably, within the guardrails of our Republic, is perhaps our nation’s greatest strength.

Yet hear me clearly: Disagreement must not lead to disunion.

And I pledge this to you: I will be a President for all Americans.

I will fight as hard for those who did not support me as for those who did.

Many centuries ago, Saint Augustine, a saint of my church, wrote that a people was a multitude defined by the common objects of their love.

What are the common objects we love that define us as Americans?

I think I know.

Opportunity.

Security.

Liberty.

Dignity.

Respect.

Honor.

And, yes, the truth.

Recent weeks and months have taught us a painful lesson.

There is truth and there are lies.

Lies told for power and for profit.

And each of us has a duty and responsibility, as citizens, as Americans, and especially as leaders – leaders who have pledged to honor our Constitution and protect our nation — to defend the truth and to defeat the lies.

I understand that many Americans view the future with some fear and trepidation.

I understand they worry about their jobs, about taking care of their families, about what comes next.

I get it.

But the answer is not to turn inward, to retreat into competing factions, distrusting those who don’t look like you do, or worship the way you do, or don’t get their news from the same sources you do.

We must end this uncivil war that pits red against blue, rural versus urban, conservative versus liberal.

We can do this if we open our souls instead of hardening our hearts.

If we show a little tolerance and humility.

If we’re willing to stand in the other person’s shoes just for a moment.
Because here is the thing about life: There is no accounting for what fate will deal you.

There are some days when we need a hand.

There are other days when we’re called on to lend one.

That is how we must be with one another.

And, if we are this way, our country will be stronger, more prosperous, more ready for the future.

My fellow Americans, in the work ahead of us, we will need each other.

We will need all our strength to persevere through this dark winter.

We are entering what may well be the toughest and deadliest period of the virus.

We must set aside the politics and finally face this pandemic as one nation.

I promise you this: as the Bible says weeping may endure for a night but joy cometh in the morning.

We will get through this, together

The world is watching today.

So here is my message to those beyond our borders: America has been tested and we have come out stronger for it.

We will repair our alliances and engage with the world once again.

Not to meet yesterday’s challenges, but today’s and tomorrow’s.

We will lead not merely by the example of our power but by the power of our example.

We will be a strong and trusted partner for peace, progress, and security.

We have been through so much in this nation.

And, in my first act as President, I would like to ask you to join me in a moment of silent prayer to remember all those we lost this past year to the pandemic.

To those 400,000 fellow Americans – mothers and fathers, husbands and wives, sons and daughters, friends, neighbors, and co-workers.

We will honor them by becoming the people and nation we know we can and should be.

Let us say a silent prayer for those who lost their lives, for those they left behind, and for our country.

Amen.

This is a time of testing.

We face an attack on democracy and on truth.

A raging virus.

Growing inequity.

The sting of systemic racism.

A climate in crisis.

America’s role in the world.

Any one of these would be enough to challenge us in profound ways.

But the fact is we face them all at once, presenting this nation with the gravest of responsibilities.

Now we must step up.

All of us.

It is a time for boldness, for there is so much to do.

And, this is certain.

We will be judged, you and I, for how we resolve the cascading crises of our era.

Will we rise to the occasion?

Will we master this rare and difficult hour?

Will we meet our obligations and pass along a new and better world for our children?

I believe we must and I believe we will.

And when we do, we will write the next chapter in the American story.

It’s a story that might sound something like a song that means a lot to me.

It’s called “American Anthem” and there is one verse stands out for me:

“The work and prayers
of centuries have brought us to this day
What shall be our legacy?
What will our children say?…
Let me know in my heart
When my days are through
America
America
I gave my best to you.”

Let us add our own work and prayers to the unfolding story of our nation.

If we do this then when our days are through our children and our children’s children will say of us they gave their best.

They did their duty.

They healed a broken land.
My fellow Americans, I close today where I began, with a sacred oath.

Before God and all of you I give you my word.

I will always level with you.

I will defend the Constitution.

I will defend our democracy.

I will defend America.

I will give my all in your service thinking not of power, but of possibilities.

Not of personal interest, but of the public good.

And together, we shall write an American story of hope, not fear.

Of unity, not division.

Of light, not darkness.

An American story of decency and dignity.

Of love and of healing.

Of greatness and of goodness.

May this be the story that guides us.

The story that inspires us.

The story that tells ages yet to come that we answered the call of history.

We met the moment.

That democracy and hope, truth and justice, did not die on our watch but thrived.

That our America secured liberty at home and stood once again as a beacon to the world.

That is what we owe our forebearers, one another, and generations to follow.

So, with purpose and resolve we turn to the tasks of our time.

Sustained by faith.

Driven by conviction.

And, devoted to one another and to this country we love with all our hearts.

May God bless America and may God protect our troops.

Thank you, America."
